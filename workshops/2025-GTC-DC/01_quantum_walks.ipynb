    "\n",
    "Let's consider a discrete walk taking place on a line. In this scenario, we envision a walker progressing along the\n",
    "x-axis in discrete increments, with the movement governed by predefined rules based on coin flips. A classical random walk can be viewed as a decision tree, as in the diagram below. Here, a walker begins in the center of the line. After a coin flip, the walker moves to the left or right depending on the outcome of the coin flip (e.g., flipping heads will send the walker one step to the left, while flipping tails will send the walker one step to the right). After $n$ coin flips, we record the position of the walker. This experiment is repeated multiple times to generate a histogram of the walker's final position.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/blob/main/quantum-applications-to-finance/images/classical-walk.png?raw=1\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum walk fundamentally differs from its classical counterpart by incorporating two key principles of quantum mechanics: **superposition** and **interference**. Instead of a classical coin that can only be heads or tails, we use a **qubit** that can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This means the walker, whose movement depends on the coin, can also move left and right at the same time, exploring multiple paths at once. As the walk progresses, these different paths can interfere with each other, either constructively (increasing the probability of finding the walker at a certain position) or destructively (decreasing it). This interference leads to drastically different probability distributions compared to the classical random walk, which results in a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates a 2-step quantum walk. We'll explain the notation in detail shortly, but for now, focus on the main result: the final distribution of the walker's possible positions is already strikingly different from the classical case.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Quantum Coin: Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of the quantum walk is the \"quantum coin.\" Unlike a classical coin which lands on either heads or tails, a quantum coin can be in a superposition of both. This is made possible by using a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical bit is the basic unit of information, having a definite state of either 0 or 1. A **qubit** (quantum bit) is the quantum analog. It can be in the state $\\ket{0}$, the state $\\ket{1}$, or a **superposition** of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we represent the basis states, known as the **computational basis**, as column vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ket{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum state, which we'll refer to as $\\ket{\\psi_C}$ to represent the state of the coin, is a linear combination of these basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi_C} = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1} = \\alpha\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\beta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers called **probability amplitudes**. When we measure the qubit, the probability of it collapsing to state $\\ket{0}$ is $|\\alpha|^2$, and the probability of it collapsing to state $\\ket{1}$ is $|\\beta|^2$. The sum of these probabilities must be 1, so $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$. For our walk, we can associate $\\ket{0}$ with \"heads\" and $\\ket{1}$ with \"tails.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenient way to visualize a single qubit's state is with the **Bloch Sphere**. On this sphere, the North Pole represents the state $\\ket{0}$ and the South Pole represents the state $\\ket{1}$. Any other point on the surface of the sphere represents a unique superposition of $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$.\n",

    "### Flipping the Coin: Applying a Quantum Gate to a Single-Qubit State\n",
    "In a classical walk, we flip the coin. In a quantum walk, we apply a **quantum gate** to the coin qubit. Quantum gates applied to a single qubit can be visualized as a rotation on the Bloch sphere and corresponds to multiplication by a unitary matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Quantum Flip: The Hadamard Gate\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine a standard choice for the \"coin flip\" operation: the **Hadamard gate (H)**, represented by the matrix\n",
    "$$H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard gate takes a computational basis state ($\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$) and puts it into an equal superposition of both:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $H\\ket{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$\n",
    "* $H\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} - \\ket{1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we start our coin in the state $\\ket{0}$ (heads) and apply the Hadamard gate, its new state is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$. Now, the coin is in a perfect superposition of heads and tails. If we were to measure it, we'd have a 50% chance of getting $\\ket{0}$ and a 50% chance of getting $\\ket{1}$. On the Bloch sphere, the Hadamard gate performs a rotation that takes the state $\\ket{0}$ from the North Pole to the positive $x$-axis.  The state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$ is commonly denoted as $\\ket{+}$.  Similarly the Hadamard gate takes the state $\\ket{1}$ to the state  $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} - \\ket{1})$, which is denoted as $\\ket{-}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Bit Flip: Pauli-X Gate (or NOT Gate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fundamental quantum gate is the **Pauli-X gate**, often called the **X gate**. It's the quantum equivalent of a classical **NOT gate**, performing a \"bit-flip\" operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $X$ gate transforms the state $\\ket{0}$ into $\\ket{1}$ and the state $\\ket{1}$ into $\\ket{0}$. The unitary matrix representing the X gate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this matrix to our basis states explicitly shows the flip:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $X\\ket{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\ket{1}$\n",

    "\n",
    "On the Bloch sphere, the $X$ gate corresponds to a 180-degree rotation around the $x$-axis. This rotation is what visually moves the state vector from the North Pole ($\\ket{0}$) to the South Pole ($\\ket{1}$), and vice-versa.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"quantum coin\" isn't limited to just the Hadamard or bit flip. In reality, any rotation on the Bloch sphere corresponds to a valid single-qubit gate, giving us an infinite set of tools for our coin-flip operation. In fact, we're not limited to constant coin operators, and could consider a coin operator that depends on parameters such as the Grover operator used for searching a graph for marked vertices ([Li and Sun](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033042), or for an exposition [Wong](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14533)). Moreover, the coin operator might depend on parameters that change from one step to the next and can be learnable, as we'll see in the next tutorial.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> For this exercise, focus your attention on the Bloch sphere to see how each gate rotates the state vector. Think about the following questions:\n",
    ">  * What do the S and T gates do? Do they change the probability of measuring 0 or 1, or do they only change the phase?\n",

This mimics how real quantum hardware operates.\n",

The `cudaq.get_state()` command allows us to retrieve the complete state vector—the complex amplitudes ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) that define the superposition.\n",

    "To connect the coin's state to the walker's movement, we use a **controlled gate**. A controlled gate is an operation that acts on one set of qubits (the *target*, our walker) only if another qubit (the *control*, our coin) is in a specific state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation that moves the walker in a discrete time quantum walk works as follows:\n",

    "* **If the coin qubit is in state $\\ket{0}$ (heads),** apply an operator (DEC) that shifts the walker one step to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates the quantum circuit for a single step of the walk. Notice the control symbols on the coin's wire: the filled-in circle (⚫) is standard notation for a control on the $\\ket{1}$ state (triggering the INC operation), and the open circle  (⚪) is for a control on the $\\ket{0}$ state (triggering the DEC operation).\n",

    "Because our quantum coin can be in a superposition like $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$, this controlled operation causes the walker to *simultaneously* move left and right. The walker's position evolves into a superposition of being one step to the left and one step to the right of its previous position(s).

We'll use these operations to build up the controlled shift operators which depend on the state of the coin.  First, let's define `INC` so that when applied to a basis state $\\ket{x}$, the result is $\\ket{(x+1)_{\\mod{16}}}$ for $x\\in \\{0,\\cdots 15\\}$.  The unitary matrix below carries out this transformation:\n",

    "> **Final Exercise:** Exploring the Discrete Time Quantum Walk\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Now it's time to experiment. Your first task is to generalize the provided code to make it more powerful.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Enable Multi-Step Walks**\n",
    "> Modify the main kernel so that it can execute the quantum walk for an arbitrary number of steps, not just one. This will allow you to observe how the walker's probability distribution evolves over time.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 🔧 Once your code is upgraded, use it to investigate the following core concepts.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Classical vs. Quantum Behavior**\n",
    "> Run a multi-step walk under two different conditions with a bit flip coin:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Condition A: Start with a \"classical\" coin (a definite state like ∣0⟩) and a walker in a definite state (e.g., $\\ket{0101}$).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Condition B: Start with a \"quantum\" coin (a superposition state like ∣+⟩)  and a walker in a definite state (e.g., $\\ket{0101}$).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Question:* Compare the final probability distributions from both conditions. How does the presence of superposition in the coin fundamentally change the walker's final state?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **The Signature of Interference**\n",
    ">Look closely at the distribution from your quantum walk (Condition B). You'll notice the most probable locations are at the edges, while the starting position is now one of the least probable. This is a direct result of quantum interference.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Question:* Why do you think the different quantum paths leading to the center cancel each other out (destructive interference), while the paths leading to the edges reinforce each other (constructive interference)?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Breaking the Symmetry**\n",
    "> The Hadamard gate acts as a \"fair\" coin, leading to a symmetric distribution.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Challenge:* Can you design a different coin-flip operator to create an asymmetric walk? Experiment with other quantum gates to see if you can make the walker consistently prefer moving in one direction. What kind of operation is needed to break the walk's symmetry?"

    "It is important to note that, as currently outlined above, we defined a quantum walk that will allow a walker to move between positions $\\ket{0}=\\ket{0000}$ and $\\ket{15}=\\ket{1111}$ in one step.  This behavior might not be desired, for instance, in a financial application where the positions of the walker represent stock prices and movement is related to positive or negative investor sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent one-step transitions between $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ , we use an auxiliary qubit (`endpoint_qubit`), Toffoli gates, CNOT gates, and a mid-circuit `reset` to ensure a coin in the state $\\ket{1}$ does not trigger a shift right (`INC`) when the walker is at $\\ket{1111}$, and a coin in the state $\\ket{0}$ does not trigger a shift left (`DEC`) when the walker is in the state $\\ket{0000}$. This process is depicted below for one step of the DTQW:\n",
