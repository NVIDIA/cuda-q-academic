For instance, a 3-qubit system (like the Exercise 4 in the next section) can be in one of $2^3 = 8$ states, and the size of the matrix representing a 3-qubit gate is $8\\times 8$.  This suggests that straightforward attempts at using matrix multiplication to simulate quantum computation on CPUs fail for circuits with only 30 or so qubits.  With CUDA-Q's platform and GPU-accelerated built-in simulators, it is possible to simulate larger systems. That said, there may one day be a fault tolerant quantum computer that can carry out computations too big for even the largest classical supercomputers.\n",
