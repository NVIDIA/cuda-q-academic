    ">**CUDA-Q Quick Tip:** By default, when using the `cudaq.sample` execution mode, qubit measurements are conducted on the standard computational basis, which is along the $z$-axis.  In the cell block below, we have added the measurement explicitly with the `mz` command. There are other measurement options `mx` and `my` built into CUDA-Q that we'll experiment with in the next section. When we specify the measurement, instead of using the `cudaq.sample` execution mode, we switch to the `cudaq.run` execution mode.  To learn more about the differences between these execution modes, see the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/examples/executing_kernels.html).\n",

    "Notice that the results from running the two kernels above differ from one another.  And thus, by switching to measurement with the `mx` command we are able to distinguish the $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ states. However, there is a drawback &#8212; measuring with `mx` doesn't allow us to distinguish $|0\\rangle$ from $|1\\rangle$, because of the Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics. Test this claim out for yourself by creating and running kernels for the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states using the `mx` measurements.\n",

When we  measure a state $|{\\psi}\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$ with `mz`we collapse the state to $|{0}\\rangle$, with a probability $|\\alpha|^2$  and will collapse the state of the qubit to  $|1\\rangle$ with probability $|\\beta|^2$. You can graphically visualize this collapse under a `mz` measurement on the Bloch sphere as projecting the state $|{\\psi}\\rangle$ onto the $z$ axis. Analogously, when we measure with `mx` we collapse our state $|\\psi\\rangle$ to either $|+\\rangle$ or $|-\\rangle$ along the $x$-axis of the Bloch sphere.\n"

Let's start with the example of the controlled-not gate, often abbreviated the `CNOT` gate. This is a gate that operates on 2 or more qubits. One of the qubits is considered the \"target\", and the remaining qubits are the \"control\".  For instance `CNOT([q0,q1],q2)` would represent a gate with control qubits in the list `[q0,q1]` and target qubit `q2`.  \n",
