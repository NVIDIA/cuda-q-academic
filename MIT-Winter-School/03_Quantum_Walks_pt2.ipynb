    "## Overview\n",
    "Efficiently loading classical data into quantum states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, underpinning a wide range of applications from quantum machine learning to financial modeling. For instance, encoding a probability distribution such as the historical closing prices of a stock over a fixed time period can be particularly demanding. In this notebook, you will adapt the Discrete Time Quantum Walk into a variational multi-Split Step Quantum Walk, capable of modeling the trading patterns of multiple investors for a specific stock. You will then optimize the walk’s parameters to effectively load the given probability distribution into a quantum state.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Encoding Probability Distributions Problem**:  Given a discrete probability distribution ${P}$, generate a quantum kernel (i.e., a sequence of quantum gates) that transforms an initial state into a final state whose measurement outcomes match the target distribution ${P}$.\n",

    "One approach to tackle this problem is through random walks by using a variational algorithm to search for the random walk that will generate a targeted distribution, as depicted in the animation below.\n",

    "Let's see this in action with the random walk widget below. The green dot represents the walker whose movements are dictated by flips of a coin whose fairness is controlled by the probability slider.

    "A significant challenge in quantum computing is the efficient encoding of classical data into quantum states that can be processed by quantum hardware or simulated on classical computers. This is particularly crucial for many financial applications, where the first step of a quantum algorithm often involves efficiently loading a probability distribution. For instance, to enable lenders to price loans more accurately based on each borrower's unique risk profile, it is essential to estimate individual loan risk distributions (such as default and prepayment) while accounting for uncertainties in modeling and macroeconomic factors. Efficiently implementing this process on a quantum computer requires the ability to load a log-normal or other complex distribution into a quantum state [(Breeden and Leonova)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01605682.2022.2115415).\n",

In brief, the logarithm of the asset price follows:\n",

That is, we will apply a quantum coinflip operation $F_1$ on $\\ket{\\psi_{C}}.$ The outcome of this flip $F_1\\ket{\\psi_{C}}$ will determine whether the walker's state shifts to the right or remains unchanged. Next, during this time step, we apply another, possibly different, quantum operation $F_2$ on the same coin. This outcome $F_2(F_1\\ket{\\psi_{C}})$ determines whether the walker's state shifts to the left or remains unchanged.  The circuit diagram for one time step of the SSQW algorithm is given below:\n",

    "## Multi-Split Step Quantum Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed in the previous section, by varying the initial state of the walker and coin, and experimenting with different coin flip operations, we can generate many different distributions.  Another variation to consider is to change the coin operations, $F_1$ and $F_2$, throughout the walk.  For example, perhaps we start with two bit flip operations to change the state of the coin in time step one and then switch to two Hadamard operations on the coin in time step 2.  Go ahead and edit the code block above to observe the newly generated probability distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge, and the focus of the remainder of this tutorial, is to identify initial states and coins that will generate a targeted probability distribution. To keep things simple, we'll fix the initial states of the coin and the walker. Using parameterized coin operations, we can employ a classical optimizer to iteratively evolve the system to generate the desired distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've just described is the ***multi-Split-Step Quantum Walk (multi-SSQW)*** framework, which we have depicted below for a one time step. To adapt this for multiple time steps, the multi-SSQW quantum circuit is replaced with one made up of `num_time_steps` copies of the block sequence of the $k$ investor's split steps.   In a financial application, the different coin operations at each time step can represent distinct investors' decision-making processes reflecting positive or negative sentiments about the value of the stock. The investor's actions can affect a stock price that is being modeled by the probability distribution ([Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12500)).\n",
