        "[Max Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) is the problem of finding a partition of a graph's nodes into two sets which maximizes the edges between the two sets. Although this problem is relatively easy to solve for graphs with few vertices, this problem is [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness#:~:text=7%20References-,Definition,complete%20problem%20G%20to%20H.).\n",
        "\n",
        "The max cut problem has a wide range of applications including [machine learning](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume14/wang13a/wang13a.pdf), [circuit design](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2020/Hong-Lee-Wei.pdf) and [statistical physics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262162554_An_Application_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_to_Statistical_Physics_and_Circuit_Layout_Design), among others. Furthermore, the QAOA algorithm presented in this tutorial can be adapted to other related optimization problems with an even wider application field including [portfolio optimization](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043204) and [job shop scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221723002072), just to name a few.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notation:** We take the convention that $G=(V,E)$ represents a graph with vertex set $V\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ and edge set $E\\subseteq V\\times V$. We use the terms vertex and node interchangeably.  For this tutorial we assume that the graphs are undirected (that is, $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ represent the same edge). Our graphs contain no self loops (i.e., for every vertex $v$, there is no edge $(v,v)$). A *cut* of the graph $G$ is a partition, $(V_0,V_1)$, of the vertex set such that every vertex of $V$ is a member of exactly one of $V_0$ or $V_1$ (i.e., $V_0\\bigcup V_1 = V$ and $V_0\\bigcap V_1=\\emptyset$). The *cut value* for a partition is the sum of the edges with one node in $V_0$ and one node in $V_1$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the images below, we illustrate two cuts of a graph with the dotted lines. Each of these cuts partitions the graph into two disjoint sets. The cut on the left is not optimal, and the cut on the right is the max cut. The cut on the left divides the graph into disjoint sets $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{0,3,4\\}$, and that cut contains 3 edges. To more easily visualize the cut, we have colored the vertices in one set of the partition green and the vertices in the other set of the partition gray.\n",
        "The cut depicted in the diagram on the right divides the graph vertices into two disjoint sets $V_0=\\{0,2\\}$, colored gray, and $V_1=\\{1,3,4\\}$, colored green. The number of edges connecting vertices in the distinct sets is computed by $$\\sum_{\\substack{u \\in V_0; v\\in V_1\\\\ (u,v) \\in E}}1.$$ For the graph on the right, the number of edges in the cut (in this case there are $5$ edges) is maximal, and this value is referred to as the *max cut value*. The partitioning $(V_0,V_1)$  &mdash; and sometimes the set of edges connecting vertices in $V_0$ and $V_1$  &mdash; is referred to as a *max cut of a graph*. Note that the max cut of a graph need not be unique; that is, two distinct partitions may produce the same cut value.\n",

        "Just as it was helpful for visualizing the partitions above, it will be helpful in this tutorial to view a solution of the max cut problem as a $2$-coloring (or a labeling) of the vertices of the graph where all nodes in $V_0$ are colored gray (or $0$) and all nodes in $V_1$ are colored green (or $1$).  Note that we make no requirements other than all nodes receive a color. In particular we do not require that adjacent vertices have distinct colors.  The coloring solely codes the partitioning of the set of vertices.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we encode the max cut problem with CUDA-Q, we will eventually use bitstrings to represent the colors of the vertices in a cut. For example using the ordering of the vertices, the bitstring `01100` captures the partition in the image above on the left with vertices $1$ and $2$ in $V_1$, and the bitstring `01011` codes the partition in the image on the right with vertices $1$, $3$, and $4$ in $V_1$.\n"

        "### 2.1 Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) Formualtion of Max Cut\n",
        "Since there are $2^{|V|}$ many distinct $2$-colorings of the graph, and $2^{|V|-1}$ distinct cuts of the graph, the brute-force approach to check every coloring of the graph is not scalable to large graphs.  There are several classical algorithms that perform better than the brute-force approach on certain subclasses of graphs, and there are heuristic algorithms that give good approximations to the max cut rather quickly. For a review of many of the classical approaches to max cut, check out [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3609426?casa_token=ZrJI6LlgDHAAAAAA%3AhuO3qe07eG0kXdWEvKY4Xv7kIDpWXpe5SAr-zB9KVzOe3nHnTSE-zqqwbbhN_syDdfrASv8xGmv29sk) and [this one](https://optimization-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4895.pdf). In this tutorial, we will be exploring a quantum heuristic algorithm for identifying good (but perhaps not maximal) cuts of graphs.  More specifically, we begin with QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) and then explore a [divide-and-conquer implementation of QAOA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11762), which is one of [many adaptations of QAOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09198.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to employ quantum algorithms, it is helpful to reframe the max cut problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem.  Suppose that we have a graph $G=(V,E)$.  We can code a partition $(V_0, V_1)$ of $V$ by defining for each $v\\in V$, a variable $x_v$ so that $x_v = 0$ if vertex $v\\in V_0$ and $x_v =1 $ if $v\\in V_1$. (Another way of thinking about this is that $x_v$ represents the coloring of a vertex $v$ as 0 or 1 depending on whether $v$ is a member of $V_0$ or $V_1$.)  The max cut problem then can be restated as finding an assignment to the variables $\\bar{x} = [x_v\\mid v\\in V]$ so that the function $$C(\\bar{x}) = \\sum_{(u,v)\\in E}(x_u+x_v-2x_u x_v)$$ is maximized.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's walk through the formula above to observe that $C(\\bar{x})$ computes the cut value of the graph for the partition coded by $\\bar{x}$. For example, notice that if $(u,v)$ were an edge and we assigned $0$ to $x_u $ and $1$ to $x_v$, this edge would be in the cut given by the partition. Furthermore, the value of the term ($x_u+x_v-2x_ux_v$) associated with this edge in the equation $C(\\bar{x})$ would be $0+1-2*0*1 = 1$.  Take a minute to consider what happens to the term associated with $(u,v)$ in the equation for $C(\\bar{x})$ if $x_u$ and $x_v$ were both assigned 1 (and therefore, the edge between them would not be in the cut). Is the result what you expected?\n",

        "QUBO problems have a natural translation to Ising Hamilitonian problems (see for instance [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11538.pdf)). This translation is carried out by mapping the binary $(0,1)$-variables $x_v$ to variables $z_v$ that take on the values $-1$ and $1$. Take a moment to verify that by assigning $-1$ and $1$ to identify a cut of a graph, the equation below computes the cut value for that cut: $$C(\\bar z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{(u,v)\\in E} (1-z_uz_v).$$ Take for instance an edge $(u,v)$ with the assignments $z_u=z_v=1$. This edge would not be in the cut determined by these variable assignments.  The term in the equation above associated with this edge would be $\\frac{1}{2}(1-z_uz_v) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1*1) = 0$ and would not contribute to the cut edge count.  Verify that the assignment $z_u=1$ and $z_v=-1$ and the assignment $z_u=z_v=-1$ both produce the result you would expect for $C(\\bar z)$ to compute the cut value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that if we multiply $C(\\bar z)$ by -1, we can reframe the optimization problem from maximization to minimization.  Furthermore, we can promote this equation to a matrix equation by replacing $z_uz_v-1$ with the Pauli-Z operator acting on qubits associated with nodes $u$ and $v$, respectively, and replacing 1 with the identity matrix. This leads to the reformulation of the problem from one of maximizing $C(\\bar{z})$ to one of minimizing the eigenvalues of $$H= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{(u,v)\\in E} (Z_uZ_v-II).$$  \n",

[Farhi et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028) (2014) originally introduced QAOA to tackle optimization problems like Max Cut. More recent research by [Farhi et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12789) (2025) have shown that QAOA can establish lower bounds on the maximum cut achievable in high girth 3-regular graphs, surpassing previously known bounds.
