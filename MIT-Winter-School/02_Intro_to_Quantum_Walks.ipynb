    "### Comparing Classical Random Walks with Discrete Time Quantum Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a discrete walk taking place on a line. In this scenario, we envision a walker progressing along the\n",
    "x-axis in discrete increments, with the movement governed by predefined rules based on coin flips.  A classical random walk can be viewed as a decision tree, as in the diagram below.  Here, a walker begins in the center of the line. After a coin flip, the walker moves to the left or right depending on the outcome of the coin flip (e.g., flipping heads will send the walker one step to the left, while flipping tails will send the walker one step to the right).  After $n$ coin flips, we record the position of the walker.  This experiment is repeated multiple times to generate a histogram of the walker's final position.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/blob/main/quantum-applications-to-finance/images/classical-walk.png?raw=1\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW)** is the quantum analogue of a classical random walk. In this scenario, **both the position of the walk and the coin are represented as quantum states**, $\\ket{\\psi_W}$ and $\\ket{\\psi_C}$, respectively. Throughout this walk, the state of the walker changes according to quantum shift operators ($S_+, S_-$) which depend on the state of the coin $\\ket{\\psi_C}$. In particular, the $S_{-}$ operation checks if $\\ket{\\psi_C}$ in the state $\\ket{0}$ (i.e., heads) and if so, induces a shift left operation $DEC$ on the quantum walker. Similarly, $S_{+}$ is defined for tails and shifting right. At each time step, the state of the coin changes (i.e., is \"flipped\") via a quantum operation ($F$), which we'll call the coin-flip operator. Unlike the classical random walk, we will not know the position of the walker until the end of the process, when the quantum state of the walker is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram below, we illustrate a 2-step quantum walk where the coin-flip operator $F$ is the Hadamard gate.  Notice how the final distribution of the walker's possible positions differs from the classical case.\n",

In other words, the computational basis state $\\ket{\\bf{i}}$ represents the $i^{th}$ location on the line.\n",

For instance, if the walker began the experiment at position $0$, then the state of the walker at time $0$ would be $\\ket{\\psi_W(0)}=\\ket{0000}$.  \n",
