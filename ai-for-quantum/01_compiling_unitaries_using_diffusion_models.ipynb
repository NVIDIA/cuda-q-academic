Compiling quantum algorithms is an incredible challenge which involves identifying a target unitary, finding an appropriate circuit representation, and then efficiently running the circuit on highly contraining hardware.\n",

This lab will explore the problem of unitary synthesis, introduce a diffusion model used in the work, and allow you to compile circuits of your own using AI.\n",

We'll begin with a general overview of diffusion models and then discuss the specific advantages they offer for circuit synthesis.\n",

To build intuition, we will first use the common example of image generation before applying these concepts to our main topic of unitary synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea: Denoising Images\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of a diffusion model is to generate high-quality samples by learning to reverse a noise-adding process, rather than learning the data distribution directly. The training begins with a clean dataset — in this case, images — to which Gaussian noise is incrementally added in a \"forward process.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To reverse this, the model employs a U-net architecture to learn the \"reverse process\" of denoising. The U-net is trained to take a noisy image as input and predict the specific noise pattern that was added to it. The model's parameters are optimized by minimizing a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the U-net is named for its U-shaped layer structure; this is purely an architectural descriptor and has no relation to the mathematical symbol $U$ for a unitary matrix. In the final stage, called inference, the model acts like an artist who starts with a block of static and \"chisels away\" the noise to reveal a clear image.\n",

The widget is grossly oversimplified, but gives a visual representation of what is happening in the training and inference stages of a diffusion model. You'll first see how an image is deliberately corrupted with noise for training. Then, you'll watch the trained model take a fresh patch of random noise and reverse the process, generating a clean new image from scratch.\n",

    "## Applying Diffusion to Unitary Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea: Denoising Circuits\n",
    "Now, let's apply the same concepts of noising and denoising to our primary goal: unitary compilation. The process follows the diagram below. First, training circuits are embedded into a data structure amenable to the neural network. Then, just like with the images, noise is added to the training data and it is input into the U-net model. The model is also given the target unitary matrix and any specific constraints (e.g., which gates to use). The output of the U-Net model is the predicted noise, and it is trained until its prediction is as accurate as possible.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/diffusion_model_inference.png\"  title=\"Diffusion Model Inference\" width=\"1200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, the process is simple and can be treated as a black box. But there are also many challenges, such as ensuring sufficient quality and quantity of training data, choosing the right model architecture, and deciding how data is encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of this approach for quantum circuit compilation is that the diffusion model learns how to denoise corrupted samples, not the distribution of the circuits themselves. Most other approaches require generating sample circuits and then comparing their behavior to the target. Such a requirement is extremely expensive, as it would require running many quantum circuit simulations, which limits scalability."

In this section we will explore a piece of this process related to **encoding** the quantum circuit.  That is, representing the quantum circuit in such a way that is amenable to AI.

We fill the matrix using a codebook, or vocabulary, where each gate has a unique number (e.g., $H = 1$, $CNOT = 2$). For gates involving multiple qubits, we use a negative sign to mark the \"control\" qubit. For instance, the Hadamard gate on qubit $q_0$ is encoded as the column vector $( 1,0,0,0)^T$. A CNOT gate with a control on $q_0$ and a target on $q_3$ is represented by the column $(-2,0,0,2)^T$.

While the training process itself is a fascinating topic, we'll focus on using the model here. You can explore training in more detail in these courses on [the basics of AI](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-01+V1) and [diffusion models](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-14+V1).\n",

Although this is a universal gate set, meaning it contains enough operations needed to construct any possible quantum circuit, performing arbitrary computations requires an incredible number of gates.  For this tutorial, we will use a model trained to generate kernels with at most 12 gates. Therefore, we can only expect the model to work for unitaries under this constraint. Let's consider here the compilation of one such unitary.\n",

    "This histogram represents why unitary compilation is so important.  With a small three qubit example, running three circuits that produce the exact same unitary, the sampled circuits with more multi-qubit gates produce inferior results.  Consider that for a fully scaled up application, good compilation might be the difference between success and a meaningless output or infeasible runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for compilation especially at scale. Researchers may be able to use such a tool to better understand the impacts of device noise or identify patterns which make for more favorable circuits.  The AI workflow you explored today is also highly flexible.  It can consider different gate sets, circuit lengths, and many other refinements to improve results. Keep an eye out for future research in this space as different AI techniques are applied to more complex quantum circuit compilation tasks."
