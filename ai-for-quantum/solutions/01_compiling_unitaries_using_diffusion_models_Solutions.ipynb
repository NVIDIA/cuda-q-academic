Compiling quantum algorithms is an incredible challenge which involves identifying a target unitary, finding an appropriate circuit representation, and then efficiently running the circuit on highly contraining hardware.\n",

This lab will explore the problem of unitary synthesis, introduce a diffusion model used in the work, and allow you to compile circuits of your own using AI.\n",

    "Now, let's apply the same concepts of noising and denoising to our primary goal: unitary compilation. The process follows the diagram below. First, training circuits are embedded into a data structure amenable to the neural network. Then, just like with the images, noise is added to the training data and it is input into the U-net model. The model is also given the target unitary matrix and any specific constraints (e.g., which gates to use). The output of the U-Net model is the predicted noise, and it is trained until its prediction is as accurate as possible.\n",

In this section we will explore a piece of this process related to **encoding** the quantum circuit.  That is, representing the quantum circuit in such a way that is amenable to AI.

Each row is a dedicated qubit, and each column is a step in time, moving from left to right and top to bottom. We fill the matrix using a codebook, or vocabulary, where each gate has a unique number (e.g., $H = 1$, $CNOT = 2$). For gates involving multiple qubits, we use a negative sign to mark the \"control\" qubit. For instance, the Hadamard gate on qubit $q_0$ is encoded as the column vector $( 1,0,0,0)^T$. A CNOT gate with a control on $q_0$ and a target on $q_3$ is represented by the column $(-2,0,0,2)^T$. The example circuit shown results in a $4\\times 8$ matrix, which includes $6$ columns for gate operations and $2$ columns of zeroes for padding to signify the end of the circuit.\n",

Although this is a universal gate set, meaning it contains enough operations needed to construct any possible quantum circuit, performing arbitrary computations requires an incredible number of gates.  For this tutorial, we will use a model trained to generate kernels with at most 12 gates. Therefore, we can only expect the model to work for unitaries under this constraint.

However, as is common in machine learning, the model has a certain accuracy, meaning not all generated circuits are expected to exactly compile the specified unitary.

    "As you have seen above, you now have almost 30 kernels that compile the desired unitary! This is particularly valuable when dealing with hardware constraints, where, for instance, you might want to avoid using certain qubits or specific gates. Here are a few scenarios where these sorts of choices matter. The rest of the notebook will work through the first case, but you can come back and work through any of these preferences.\n",

    "2. Certain QPUs like neutral atom and superconducting processors can trivially implement $Z$ gates using software control, while $X$ gates require a more error prone pulse. Thus, for these modalities, it is favorable to produce circuits with a bias towards $Z$ gates over $X$ gates, holding the number of two qubit gates constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When considering quantum error correction (QEC), the type of QEC code can dictate which types of gates are transversal, meaning they can be trivially applied to all data qubits to produce the logical gate.  This can change from code to code, so selecting circuits which maximize the number of transversal gates is a ideal. This can even mean favoring transversal CNOT gates over non-transversal single qubit gates.\n",

    "This histogram represents why unitary compilation is so important.  With a small three qubit example, running three circuits that produce the exact same unitary, the sampled circuits with more multi-qubit gates produce inferior results.  Consider that for a fully scaled up application, good compilation might be the difference between success and a meaningless output or infeasible runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for compilation especially at scale. Researchers may be able to use such a tool to better understand the impacts of device noise or identify patterns which make for more favorable circuits.  The AI workflow you explored today is also highly flexible.  It can consider different gate sets, circuit lengths, and many other refinements to improve results. Keep an eye out for future research in this space as different AI techniques are applied to more complex quantum circuit compilation tasks."
