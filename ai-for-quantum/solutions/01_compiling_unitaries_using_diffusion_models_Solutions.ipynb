Compiling quantum algorithms is an incredible challenge which involves identifying a target unitary, finding an appropriate circuit representation, and then efficiently running the circuit on highly contraining hardware.\n",

    "Now, let's apply the same concepts of noising and denoising to our primary goal: unitary compilation. The process follows the diagram below. First, training circuits are embedded into a data structure amenable to the neural network. Then, just like with the images, noise is added to the training data and it is input into the U-net model. The model is also given the target unitary matrix and any specific constraints (e.g., which gates to use). The output of the U-Net model is the predicted noise, and it is trained until its prediction is as accurate as possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of this approach for quantum circuit compilation is that the diffusion model learns how to denoise corrupted samples, not the distribution of the circuits themselves. Most other approaches require generating sample circuits and then comparing their behavior to the target. Such a requirement is extremely expensive, as it would require running many quantum circuit simulations, which limits scalability.\n",

    "An important consideration for all AI applications is how the data is preprocessed before being input to the model.  In this section we will explore a piece of this process related to **encoding** the quantum circuit.  That is, representing the quantum circuit in such a way that is amenable to AI. Note that the target unitary and text prompt inputs are themselves prepared with distinct neural networks which will not be discussed here.\n",

    "The figure below explains how we translate a quantum circuit diagram into a numerical, or **tokenized matrix**. Think of the matrix as a timeline of the circuit. Each row is a dedicated qubit, and each column is a step in time, moving from left to right and top to bottom. We fill the matrix using a codebook, or vocabulary, where each gate has a unique number (e.g., $H = 1$, $CNOT = 2$). For gates involving multiple qubits, we use a negative sign to mark the \"control\" qubit. For instance, the Hadamard gate on qubit $q_0$ is encoded as the column vector $( 1,0,0,0)^T$. A CNOT gate with a control on $q_0$ and a target on $q_3$ is represented by the column $(-2,0,0,2)^T$. The example circuit shown results in a $4\\times 8$ matrix, which includes $6$ columns for gate operations and $2$ columns of zeroes for padding to signify the end of the circuit.\n",

While the training process itself is a fascinating topic, we'll focus on using the model here. You can explore training in more detail in these courses on [the basics of AI](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-01+V1) and [diffusion models](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-14+V1).\n",

    "The first step is to select a unitary to compile. This model has been trained to compile unitaries arising from circuits composed of the gates `['h', 'cx', 'z', 'x', 'ccx', 'swap']`. Although this is a universal gate set, meaning it contains enough operations needed to construct any possible quantum circuit, performing arbitrary computations requires an incredible number of gates.  For this tutorial, we will use a model trained to generate kernels with at most 12 gates. Therefore, we can only expect the model to work for unitaries under this constraint. Let's consider here the compilation of one such unitary.\n",

However, as is common in machine learning, the model has a certain accuracy, meaning not all generated circuits are expected to exactly compile the specified unitary.

    "This histogram represents why unitary compilation is so important.  With a small three qubit example, running three circuits that produce the exact same unitary, the sampled circuits with more multi-qubit gates produce inferior results.  Consider that for a fully scaled up application, good compilation might be the difference between success and a meaningless output or infeasible runtime.  \n",

    "\n",
    "AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for compilation especially at scale. Researchers might be able to use such a tool to better understand the impacts of device noise or identify patterns which make for more favorable circuits.  The AI workflow you explored today is also highly flexible.  It can consider different gate sets, circuit lengths, and many other refinements to improve results. Keep an eye out for future research in this space as different AI techniques are applied to more complex quantum circuit compilation tasks."
