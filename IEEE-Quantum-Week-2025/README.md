# Accelerating Quantum Computing Adoption: A Hands-on Tutorial with CUDA-Q and Amazon Braket

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to many 

**What you'll learn today**
Use the CUDA-Q programming framework on Amazon Braket to implement and evaluate solutions on CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. 

In Notebooks 1 & 2, you'll dive into the fundamentals of quantum walks, see how they differ from classical random walks, and apply them to model financial data. These notebooks cover many features of CUDA-Q that you can apply to a variety of applications.

In Notebook 3, you'll implement QAOA first on a simulator and then you'll conduct a resource estimation exercise to run the QAOA example on quantum hardware within specified shot limits.

**Where you can learn more***
For those wanting to continue exploring CUDA-Q beyond this tutorial, you can find an extension of Notebook 3 which compares QAOA to quantum annealing and the state of the art Q-CHOP algorithm developed by JP Morgan Chase and Infleqtion on the open-source [CUDA-Q Academic github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic).  There, you'll find many other lessons that introduce quantum computing concepts alongside the AI and HPC skills used to overcome challenges such as qubit design, error correction, and scalability.

**Pre-requisites:** Learners should have familiarity with Jupyter notebooks and programming in Python and CUDA-Q. It is assumed the reader has some familiarity already with quantum computation and is comfortable with braket notation and the concepts of qubits, quantum circuits, measurement, and circuit sampling. The CUDA-Q Academic course entitled "[Quick Start to Quantum Computing with CUDA-Q](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/quick-start-to-quantum)" provides a walkthrough of this prerequisite knowledge if the reader is new to quantum computing and CUDA-Q or needs refreshing.  These notebooks are included in the workshop folder.
