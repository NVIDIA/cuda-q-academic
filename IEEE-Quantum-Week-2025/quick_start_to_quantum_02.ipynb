For instance, a 3-qubit system (like the Exercise 4 in the next section) can be in one of $2^3 = 8$ states, and the size of the matrix representing a 3-qubit gate is $8\\times 8$.  This suggests that straightforward attempts at using matrix multiplication to simulate quantum computation on CPUs fail for circuits with only 30 or so qubits.  With CUDA-Q's platform and GPU-accelerated built-in simulators, it is possible to simulate larger systems. That said, there may one day be a fault tolerant quantum computer that can carry out computations too big for even the largest classical supercomputers.\n",

Like the classical interference of waves from raindrops on the surface of a puddle, constructive interference occurs when the probability amplitude of basis state is increased, and destructive interference occurs when the probability of a basis state decreases due to the action of quantum gates.  The previous example demonstrates both constructive and deconstructive interference. The circuit is initialized in a state having equal magnitude probability amplitudes, but after applying the CNOT gate and Hadamard gate, the probabilities of measuring $\\ket{110}$, $\\ket{011}$, $\\ket{111}$, and $\\ket{010}$ have each been amplified, while the probabiliy amplitudes associated with the other basis states have been reduced to $0$.\n",

In the previous lab, we mentioned that any rotation of the Bloch sphere corresponds to a quantum gate on one qubit. So in theory, there are an infinite number of possible quantum gates: one for each of the possible rotations of the sphere.  In this section, we'll first detail what these rotations gates look like both as matrices and as CUDA-Q operations.

But how do we implement gates for other angles of rotation, or different axis of rotation?  One easy answer is to use some of the gate operations built into CUDA-Q.  These include the `y`-gate for 180 degree rotation about the $y$-axis and the `z`-gate for 180 degree rotation about the $z$ axis.  The `t` and `s` gates correspond to other fixed angle rotations about the $z$ axis.  \n",
