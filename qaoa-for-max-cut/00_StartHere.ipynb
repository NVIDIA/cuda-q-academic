        " The Max Cut problem is an optimization problem defined as: *Given a graph $G$, find the maximum cut of $G$*, where the maximum cut (max cut) of a graph is defined to be a partitioning of the vertices into two disjoint sets so that the number of edges between the two partitions is maximized. The Max Cut problem is a [NP-hard problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness), and there is a rich body of research to develop classical and quantum algorithms to solve and/or approximate the max cut for large subclasses of graphs. Some of these algorithms fall under the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Divide and conquer breaks a large problem into smaller problems which are simple enough to be solved directly.  Additionally, this paradigm lends itself to parallel computation since the smaller problems can often be solved independently. Recently, this approach has been applied to the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for max cut ([arXiv:2205.11762v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11762), [arxiv.2101.07813v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07813), [arxiv:2304.03037v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03037), [arxiv:2009.06726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06726), and [arxiv:2406:17383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17383)). In the literature the divide-and-conquer approach to max cut with QAOA is sometimes referred to as QAOA-in-QAOA or $\\text{QAOA}^2$.  In this tutorial, we will introduce this algorithm and implement parallel computation with CUDA-Q.  \n",

        "\n",
        " This tutorial begins in Lab 1 with a demonstration of solving the Max Cut problem for a small graph with QAOA. To set the groundwork for the remaining labs, Lab 1 ends with a preview of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. In Lab 2, we walk through one level of the divide-and-conquer algorithm, and we follow that up in Lab 3 with the recursive implementation for much larger and denser graphs. Additionally in Labs 2 and 3, we experiment with running quantum circuits in parallel on GPUs. Finally, learners can take the assessment in Lab 4 in which they are challenged to approximate the weighted max cut problem.\n",
