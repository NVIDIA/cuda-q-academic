    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this QEC series, all of the QEC procedures have been contextualized as critical for realizing FTQC.  However, FTQC is broader than QEC and involves careful consideration of all operations such that errors are not propagated through a computation.  That is to say, implementing syndrome extraction of a QEC code correctly is a key step for preserving quantum memory, but still requires a set of FT operations (state prep, gate, measurement, etc) to perform computations in a way that ensures a single errors do not propogate uncontrollably.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, proper FT implementation of the Steane code would require logically encoded ancilla qubits to measure the stabilizers to make sure an ancilla qubit error does not become an uncorrectable error itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many aspects of FTQC that will not be covered here. However, the concept of a universal gate set needs to be introduced before the MSD protocol can be understood.  A **universal gate set** is a set of quantum gates from which any unitary operation can be approximated to arbitrary precision. The is analogous to classical computing where any digital computation can be constructed from AND, NOT, and OR gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain gates, known as **transversal gates**, are nice to have in a gate set, because they are already fault tolerant.  A transversal gate can be applied individually to every data qubit encoding a logical qubit such that if any of them have an error, it only affects the target data qubit. An example of a transversal get would be the $X$ operation in the Steane code.  A logical $X$ is obtained by performing an $X$ on each data qubit and if any of those result in an error, it is correctable and will not propagate to the other data qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, all that is needed for FTQC to be easy is a universal gate set consisting only of transversal gates.  Unfortunately, no such set exists. The **Eastin-Knill** Theorem proves that no quantum error-correcting code can implement a universal set of gates using only transversal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common universal gate set is the Clifford + T gates. The Clifford gates, such as $H$, $S$, and CNOT, are the gates that map Pauli operators to other Pauli operators under conjugation. The $T$ gate, while not part of the Clifford group, is necessary to promote the Clifford gate set to a universal gate set. In most quantum error-correcting codes, the $T$ gate cannot be implemented transversally. In the case of the Steane code, the Clifford gates can be implemented transversally (see figure below), but the $T$ gate is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Images/MSD/cliffplust.drawio.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider why the $T$-gate is necessary for the universal gate set.  For any logical operation $\\bar{U}$, it must transform all stabilizers $s_i \\in S$  into another $s_j \\in S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$H$ does this fine as $H \\otimes X \\otimes H ^{\\dagger} = Z \\in S$ and $H \\otimes Z \\otimes H ^{\\dagger} = X \\in S$.\n",

    "$T$ does transform $Z$ into a valid stabilizer, but not the $X$ stabilizers.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$T \\otimes X \\otimes T ^{\\dagger} = e^{i \\pi/4}SZX \\notin S$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The $T$ gate ends up being the key to any advantage realized by quantum algorithms. This is because without $T$ gates, the other gates could only jump between the six pole states of the Bloch sphere, which can be simulated efficiently with classical computing.  Explore this fact with the widget [linked here](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-q-academic/qec101/Images/MSD/bloch_sphere.html).  Notice how the T gate is the only operation capable of producing a non-pole state. "

Then, the bottom wire is prepared in a so called magic state,  $\\frac{\\ket{0} + e^{i\\pi/4}\\ket{1}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  A fault tolerant CNOT gate is then applied with the magic state qubit as the control. The target qubit is then measured and if the result is a 0, $T$ was successfully applied to $\\ket{\\psi}$. If measurement produces a 1, then a FT SX gate is applied to the qubit and the result becomes $T$ applied to $\\ket{\\psi}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Prepare Magic State\" subcircuit is deceptively simple.  It consists of a single logical Hadamard gate followed by a noisy $T$ gate to form $\\ket{T}$. This process may seem circular as a $T$ gate is required in the process to apply a fault tolerant $T$ gate.  However, the procedure is a bit more nuanced. A \"good enough\" (high enough fidelity) magic state is the output of an onerous process called magic state distillation (MSD).  MSD will be discussed more in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another distinction is that the magic state can only be produced from an easy to prepare logical 0 state.  Only by performing the fault tolerant circuit above, can the $T$ gate act on an arbitrary qubit state $\\ket{\\psi_L}$. \n",

Then, implement the circuit below. This circuit essentially maps the stabilizer measurements of the code to qubits 1,2,3 and 4 which need to be measured to produce a syndrome. Note that this version of the [[5,1,3]] code is slightly different from the version used by QuEra, but is more amenable to gate operations native to CUDA-Q.
