This is because decoding requires measurements on a QPU, data transfer to the supercomputer, decoding on the supercomputer, and then data transfer back to the QPU.  The time available for this is called the **decoding window** and varies based on a number of factors such as the qubit modality, data transfer rates, and the volume of information that needs to be decoded.\n",

    "The simulation below makes this more clear.  First, set the time for the decoding window. All 50 syndromes must be decoded in this time, otherwise the QEC procedure fails.

Try changing the parameters of the distribution and see how this impacts the decoder's success rate.\n",

High-distance codes are necessary for accuracy, but unfortunately introduce high-qubit overheads and make decoding much more challenging. Advances in QEC code design and low-latency integration between AI supercomputers and QPUs alleviate pressure on the decoding step, but it nevertheless remains the primary bottleneck of QEC."

    "## 4.2 Pauli Frames and Error Tracking ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, when errors are identified by the decoder, they are not immediately corrected but are tracked using a Pauli frame. The Pauli frame keeps track of the corrections classically and applies them later. This approach reduces the number of gate operations required to fix errors on the QPU, thereby protecting the encoded state from additional noise introduced by each correction gate. For instance, if a bit flip error occurs on qubit 1 in the first round and another bit flip error happens on the same qubit later, the two errors cancel each other out, eliminating the need for a correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, codes are depicted using 3D images like the one below. In this case, each plane is a Steane code QEC round with flagged errors in purple. Each error is saved, and the list grows with future rounds. The final Paul frame, $[X_1, X_5, X_1]$, is the list of corrections for the three bit flip errors that have occurred over all the rounds: two on qubit 1 and one on qubit 5.  In the last step, the errors can be simplified, for example, $X_1X_1 = I$, so only one of the three corrections, $X_5$, needs to be applied. This is a rather trivial example, and often diagrams like this are used to depict more complex codes and their respective error pathways.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dimension of time can also lend itself to more sophisticated decoding schemes. This is particularly important when measurement errors occur during the stabilizer checks. In this case, it might appear that a stabilizer flags when in fact the data qubits are fine. Multiple decoding rounds can demonstrate that the false stabilizer flag is a consequence of measurement error and not a true error, where other true errors would persist without correction. Such an approach is more powerful but requires decoding of much more complex syndromes. The diagram below demonstrates this concept with an example.\n",

    "<img src=\"Images/decoder/decodeintime.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"/>\n",
    "Notice how, in the first case, the decoder has kept track of a measurement error and is therefore making an incorrect syndrome in the final case. When decoding happens over time, the decoding task must not decode a 19-bit syndrome but is able to flag measurement errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of decoding in time is that the measurement errors can be factored into the decoding process.  However, the tradeoff is that the decoding problem is much harder.  When decoding in time, an effective parity check matrix must be constructed as an input to the decoder. In this exercise you will build $H^{(2)}$ for a two round Steane code that includes consistency checks to  flag errors between the two time steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, a few hints.  Consider the dimensions. The number of columns still corresponds to the number of qubits, but, now we need to take into account the data qubits at time 0, the data qubits at time 1, and the three ancilla qubits used to measure syndromes between the two rounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time step will have the same three stabilizer checks, so $H^{(2)}$ should have six rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top left block of $H^{(2)}$ and the bottom right block will be $H$, where $H$ is the standard Steane code parity check matrix.\n",

    "What do the middle three columns need to be for $H^{(2)}$ to be able to catch measurement errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Build $H^{(2)}$, and then build an error vector $e$ of size 17 such that each entry is a 0 or a 1 if an error occurred on that qubit.  Compute $H^{(2)}e^T$ for a case with an error on data qubit 1 in the first time step, an error on data qubit 1 in the second time step only, and a measurement error. Note, it is best practice to assume that the decoder will not hanndle raw syndrome outputs, but the differences between he current set of measurements and the next round.  For example, after preparation the syndrome 101 might be measured. If the next round produces the same stabilizer measurerments, the decoder would see 000 not 101. This syntax makes it much easier for decoders to handle data in more complex settings."

    "Training AI decoders is a very challenging task and must be used in the proper setting. For example, if the error rate in the training data is very low, The AI model could discover that it can produce pretty good results just by predicting no error each time.  This sort of model does not learn anything about decoding!  Thus, expert care must go into the fine-tuning and validation of AI decoders to ensure they are working properly. The steane code is rather simple and with only $2^7$ possible errors the training data can cover all possible errors. AI decoders in practice can only be trained on a subset of the possible errors, yet must be able to learn enough to decode with high enough accuracy. \n",

    "## Belief Propagation Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Another state-of-the-art decoding method is belief propagation (BP).  BP is a powerful technique borrowed from classical error correction that is highly flexible and can serve as a black box decoder for arbitrary QEC Codes. It is particularly useful for codes like quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC). All the user needs to do is provide a parity check matrix and then feed the decoder syndromes to decode. \n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA created a GPU accelerated BP decoder which allows researchers to push QEC even further than before.  This section will walk you through implementing BP and how to use NVIDIA's accelerated BP decoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, BP works by taking initial beliefs about each data qubit's physical error rate and, using syndrome measurements, iteratively update these beliefs to converge on a solution which provides a likelihood of an error occurring or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are different variations of BP, one implementation is the following:\n",
    "1. Initialize a log-likelihood ratio $L_{v_i} = log(\\frac{1-p}{p})$ for each data qubit $v_i$ where $p$ is the physical error rate.  If an error is unlikely, the quantity is positive and increases in magnitude the smaller $p$ is as errors are less likley.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. $L_{v_i\\rightarrow c_j}$, the message sent from each data qubit to a check qubit, is calculated based on the following equation:  $L_{v\\rightarrow c} = L_i + \\sum_{k \\in N(i)/j} L_{c_k\\rightarrow v_i}$ where $\\sum_{k \\in N(i)/j}$ includes all of the check qubits connected to data qubit $v_i$ excluding check qubit $c_j$. That is, the check qubit is updated with beliefs the variable learned from the *other* check qubits it is connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Similarly, $L_{c_j\\rightarrow v_i}$ is computed to compute the messages sent back to the variable qubits using $L_{c_j \\to v_i} = (-1)^{s_j} \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\text{arctanh} \\left( \\prod_{k \\in N(j) \\setminus i} \\tanh \\left( \\frac{L_{v_k \\to c_j}}{2} \\right) \\right)$ where $N(j) \\setminus i$ is all *other* variable nodes connected to $c_j$ excluding $v_i$ and $s_j$ is the value of the syndrome measurement for $c_j$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Finally, the final beliefs $L_{\\text{final}, i}$ are computed as $L_i + \\sum_{j \\in N(i)} L_{c_j \\to v_i}$, summing the prior beliefs with the final messages sent to each variable node. From this a decision can be made where positive numbers indicate no error and negative an error, with the magnitudes related to confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, BP will converge to a solution that agrees with the original syndrome and correct the error.  If BP cannot converge, it means there is still significant uncertainty whether some of the bits have errors or not and postprocessing is necessary to refine the result.  This will be discussed in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the start of a BP implementation for decoding the 5-qubit repetition code. Fill in the sections marked \"TODO\" to complete the code.  See if you can successfully \n"

    "You should notice a very high logical error rate. Each of these logical error rates is a case where BP could not converge.  Like any numerical solver, it is possible to increase iterations and perform a number of tricks to help BP, but some particularly difficult syndromes will not converge either way. To solve this, BP decoders are often paired with optional ordered statistics decoding (OSD) which performs post-processing to improve the result.  Thus, you might often see a \"BP+OSD\" decoder. \n",

    "The intuition behind OSD decoding is to solve for the errors directly using matrix inversion.  That is, solving $e = H^{-1}s$ where $e$ is a vector with error locations, $s$ is the syndrome, and $H$ is the parity check matrix.  The procedure cannot be performed with the original $H$, so instead, a square matrix with columns of full-rank must be constructed from the columns of $H$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this approach challenging is selecting the right columns.  Many different solutions can be obtained with different column selections, but without guidance, this will likely result in a solution that is not of minimum weight and induce a logical error. Recall, for the most likely error decoder above, that valid errors with high weight are much less likely than low weight errors.  Same idea here, but rather than computing all combinations, the OSD heuristic provides a clever way to search from a really good starting point that is the output of BP. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of BP assigns a probability of error to each data qubit.  This naturally informs the reordering of the columns to rank from most to least likely to have an error. Next Gaussian elimination is performed on $H$ to determine the first full columns of full rank. These subcolumns are then inverted to get $H^{-1}$ which is multiplied by $s$ to get the error result $e_{[s]}$. The $e_{[s]}$ is then padded with zeros  $e_{[T]} =0$ which results in a total error profile of $ e = (e_{[s]},e_{[T]})$.  \n",

Perform OSD manually and find the error profile that satisfies the syndrome. Note, all computations must be performed using mod 2 arithmetic.  This can be accomplished using the `galois` library which creates a Galois field and allows all `numpy` operations to compute mod 2."
