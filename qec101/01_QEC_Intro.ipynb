    "Classical [Error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code) (EC) is the practice of redundantly encoding data using additional bits such that if some of the data bits are corrupted (flipped from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa) by external noise, the error can be fixed and the integrity of the original data preserved. There are many potential ways to accomplish this and any specific procedure is referred to as an EC code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thanks to EC that you can still watch a DVD that has many scratches, enjoy a clear telephone conversation despite the signal becoming noisy after transmission over long distances, or scan a QR code at a restaurant that is partially obscured. Try it yourself. Pull up a QR code and try covering different parts with your hand and notice that your phone can still interpret the link despite obfuscation of some parts of the grid. EC has its limits, but in many cases can essentially eliminate any negative impacts of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five aspects to any general EC procedure: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All EC procedures assume there is some initial information that needs to be preserved or transmitted. The sender and recipient need to interact with the same information even if it is stored in different ways throughout an EC procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  An EC procedure first **encodes** the information across $n$ data bits such that $n$ is larger than the minimum number of bits necessary to store the information. For example, the repitition code that we'll cover in the next section uses 3 bits to encode some binary information stored on a single bit by simply repeating the information stored on the single bit three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The encoding procedure produces **logical codewords** which are the redundant encodings that map to the logical states.  For example, logical 1 could be defined with the codeword 111.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A logical codeword then proceeds through a **noisy channel**.  A noisy channel has some probability of randomly corrupting (flipping) any of the data bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  The recipient then receives the encoded data and needs to decode it to determine if an error occurred and how they might fix it. Another way to say this, is that the **decoder** takes the message the recipient receives and determines which logical codeword is \"closest\" to it. If the decoder produces the correct logical codeword, the EC procedure worked. If not, a **logical error** occurred and the recipient incorrectly interprets the message - the worst case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "No EC procedure is perfect, and is usually benchmarked against **[Shannon's limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem)** which is the theoretical limit of the rate of noise free data transfer that can occur through a channel with a given bandwidth and noise level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, and EC code need to be just \"good enough\" to ensure that errors do not usually impede the target application. Generally speaking, the more redundancy (extra bits) used in the encoding process, the better the EC will be, but this also comes at the cost of more memory and time to perform more sophisticated encoding and decoding. Thus, there is always a tension between the resources available for error correction and the logical error rate of the procedure necessary for a given application."

    "\n",
    "Now, assume $0_L$ is transmitted through a noisy channel such that each data qubit has a probability p=0.1 of flipping erroneously. This means there are eight possible states the encoded message could be in after proceeding through the noisy channel. The states can be sorted into two groups. The space of all logical codewords (000 and 111) is called the **codespace**: \n",

    "\n",
    "The job of the decoder is to map encodings in the error space back to a logical codeword in the codespace.  This is usually done through the help of a calculated property that describes the state called a **syndrome**.  In this case, the syndrome is a majority count of the bits. So, the syndrome of the 101 state would be 2 (the count of how many 1's) and corresponds to logical 1 and the syndrome of 001 would be 1.  Additionally, the syndrome of 111 is 3 and the syndrome of 000 os 0.  So we can apply the decoding rule that a message with a syndrome of 2 or 3 would be decoded as 111, and message with a syndrome of 0 or 1 would be decoded as 000.\n",

    "Any single bit error can be correctly identified and corrected, but two or more bit flips will result in a logical error.  There is no way to know for certain if 110, for example, is a single error from the $1_L$ codeword or two bit errors from the $0_L$ codeword. However, the repetition code still greatly reduces the probability of a logical error compared to no encoding. To be very conservative you could discard results where any error was detected and resend the message.  In this error detection (not correction) case,  a logical error will only occur in the highly unlikely case of three bit flip errors, where 000 was transmitted but 111 was received.  This approach requires additional data transfers to compensate for the cases where errors occurred. Error correction can eliminate the need for extra data transfers at the expense of possibly mistaking a 2-bit error for a 1-bit error.  This hints at an important property of error correction codes: distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Codes are characterized with the so called [n,k,d] notation where n is the number of data bits used to encode k logical bits and d is the **distance**. The distance is the number of errors that must occur for one logical codeword to become the next closest codeword. In our example of the three bit repetition code $n=3$, $k = 1$, and $d=3$, so we refer to this as a [3,1,3] code. The number of errors a code can correct $t$ is a function of code distance and can be calculated as $t = \\text{floor}[(d-1)/2]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows the likelihood of the four possible scenarios below. Notice the three bit repetition code with majority count will transmit the message with 0.972 probability of success, a significant improvement over the original probability of 0.9.  The **logical error rate** is equal to $1-p$, where $p$ is the probability of success.  In the case of the 3-bit repetition code, the logical error rate is 0.028.\n",

    "## 1.3 More Efficient EC Codes (The Hamming Code)\n",
    "\n",

The [7,4,3] Hamming code consists of four data bits ($d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$) and three additional parity check bits ($p_1, p_2, p_3$). This example will only consider single bit errors as this is another distance 3 code and can only correct single bit errors. \n",

    "This is accomplished by each parity bit encoding a parity, or the mod2 sum of a subset of the data bits.  The [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code) below depicts the encoding.  In this example, $p_1$ encodes the parity of $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_4$.  If our data bits ($d_1d_2d_3d_4$) were 0110, then $p_1$ would be calculated to be 1.\n",

The parity bits that disagree flag an error. \n",

    "QEC shares the same goal as classical EC, but comes with a number of unique challenges thanks to the properties of quantum mechanics.  This section will list the primary differences, and the following section will explain how these challenges can be addressed.\n",
    " \n",
    "1.  Continuous Errors - Classical errors are always discrete bit flips. Quantum errors are continuous and can manifest in an infinite number of ways, potentially shifting a qubit's state to any point on the Bloch sphere. For instance, the figure below illustrates many possible errors that affect a qubit starting in the $\\ket{0}$ state. Errors can perturb states incoherently (from environmental effects) or coherently from slight hardware imperfections. This invites the question, \"Does QEC require an infinite amount of resources to correct errors?\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "<img src=\"Images/c_error.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No Cloning - Quantum states cannot be copied. That is to say that the following expression holds:$~\\nexists U \\text{ such that } U(\\ket{\\psi} \\otimes \\ket{\\rho}) =  \\ket{\\psi} \\otimes\\ket{\\psi}$. This means we cannot just send multiple copies of the quantum state through the noisy channel like the classical repetition code. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Destructive Measurement - In classical EC, the state can be accessed at any time, making decoding much easier. Measuring a quantum state collapses it, making the EC moot if the state is destroyed. Therefore, more clever ways to extract syndromes are required. A secondary consequence of this fact is sampling error.  Even if an algorithm could perform perfectly ensuring no sources of error, many applications require statistical sampling of the resulting state. If we sampled $\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}$ the frequency of 0's would be close to $\\alpha^2$ but deviate based on the number of samples per the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability - Though scalability is an issue for classical EC, it is far more severe for QEC. Today's noisy intermediate scale quantum devices are very difficult to control, so each additional qubit required for QEC comes at great cost.  Qubits also have short coherence times, so QEC procedures must complete within strict time constraints which gets harder at scale. Finally, the threshold theorem is in play. In classical EC, adding more bits always reduces the logical error rate. This is not true for quantum - physical qubits must have noise below a specific threshold in order for scaling the code to improve the error rates,  otherwise, the results just get worse.\n"

Execute the code block below and use the slider to change the number of rotation gates executed to see how the error can become substantial.
