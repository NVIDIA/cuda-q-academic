    "An important subclass of QEC codes, known as **stabilizer codes**, use special operations called **stabilizers** to clean up errors in encoded quantum information, and thus \"stabilize\" the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An operation $s$ acting on a state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is said to be a stabilizer of the state if the state is a +1 eigenstate of the operation $s \\ket{\\psi} = +1 \\ket{\\psi}$. The high-level intuiton here is that if small errors have accumulated in a logically encoded state, the action of applying this stabilizer is to project the state back to a perfectly error-free state, and we measure $+1$. Sometimes larger errors occur, and we do not measure $+1$, which informs us something has gone wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab 1, the codespace was defined by the set of basis codewords, such as $\\ket{000}$ and $\\ket{111}$ for the 3-qubit quantum repetition code. In that lab the codewords were provided to you for each code, but in a stabilizer code, we can equivalently define the codespace by providing the stabilizers which stabilize each basis codeword.  In practice, this process of defining a code by the stabilizers is much more efficient and scalable as the codes grow larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codespace $C$ can be defined as formed by all $\\ket{\\psi}$ such that $s_i\\ket{\\psi} = +1 \\ket{\\psi}$ for each $s_i\\in S$, where these $s_i$ are stabilizers which form a group $S$ (note: in some texts this group $S$ is called the stabilizer, not the elements). That is, the codespace is the joint +1 eigenspace fixed by the stabilizers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again in lab 1, we were given the codespace and error space for the 3-qubit quantum repetition code up front. However, let's think about working backwards from the computational basis for the 3-qubit Hilbert space. These can be sorted based on the eigenvalues returned when operated on by all elements of the stabilizer group $S = \\{Z_1Z_2, Z_2Z_3\\}$: \n",

    "The basis states that have an eigenvalue of 1 for both $Z_1Z_2$ and $Z_2Z_3$ make up the codespace $\\ket{000}$ and $\\ket{111}$. There are other valid stabilizers in this code, such as $Z_1 Z_3$, but any stabilizer group can be boiled down into a minimal set which can be multiplied together to generate all of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a really powerful approach, because it eliminates the need to derive and document the basis of the codespace in advance. Instead, one can simply define an appropriate set of stabilizers to establish the codespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stabilizer codes are usually characterized as $[[n,k,d]]$ (double brackets for quantum codes) where $n$ is the number of physical qubits encoding $k$ logical qubits with distance $d$. It is always the case that these codes require $n-k$ stabilizers. The reason for this is that each stabilizer splits the original $2^n$ Hilbert space in two (the +1 and -1 eigenspace), with $2^1 = 2$ degrees of freedom remaining to define the logical qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trick then becomes finding good sets of stabilizers that correspond to QEC codes with favorable properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stabilizer Properties \n",
    "\n",
    "Three key properties for $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Here we consider only to Pauli product stabilizers, that is, $s_i$ needs to be a Pauli-group element. The n-qubit Pauli group $G_n$ is a special group constructed from the Pauli matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The group $G_n$ consists of $4*4^n$ elements and is built by forming a group that begins with all possible length $n$ Pauli words. For example $G_3$ has  terms like $IZZ$, $ZXZ$, $YYY$, etc. The group is then closed by including the possible scalar cofficients which arise from multiplying these terms $\\{ 1, -1, i, -i\\}$. So $G_1$ would be\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$G_1 \\equiv \\{\\pm I, \\pm iI,\\pm Z, \\pm iZ,\\pm X, \\pm iX,\\pm Y, \\pm iY\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each $s_i$ must be able to operate on every logical state $\\ket{\\psi_L}$. Furthermore, this action should leave each $\\ket{\\psi_L}$ fixed (i.e., the eigenvalue of $\\ket{\\psi_L}$ should be +1 for each logical state).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stabilizers need to be measurable in any order. This means each stabilizer needs to **commute** with every other stabilizer (that is, $s_is_j = s_js_i$, or equivalently $[s_i, s_j] \\equiv s_is_j - s_js_i=0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to stabilizers, each $[[n,k,d]]$ code has $2k$ **logical operators** ($\\bar{X}_i$ and $\\bar{Z}_i$) which perform $X$ and $Z$ operations on the logical states. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{Z}_2\\bar{X}_1\\ket{11}_L = \\bar{Z}_2\\ket{01}_L = -\\ket{01}_L $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These logical operators must satisfy two properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\bar{X}_i$ and $\\bar{Z}_i$ commute with all stabilizers.\n",
    "2. $\\bar{X}_i$ and $\\bar{Z}_i$ must **anticommute** with one another if acting on the same logical qubit (i.e.,  $\\{\\bar{X}_i,\\bar{Z}_j\\}\\equiv \\bar{X}_i\\bar{Z}_j + \\bar{Z}_j\\bar{X}_i= 2\\delta_{ij}I$ for all $i,j$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections will make use of stabilizers to solidify these concepts and enable coding of QEC codes far more interesting than the quantum repetition code. "

    "## 2.3 Steane Code Capacity Analysis with CUDA-Q QEC\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[CUDA-QX](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-qx) is set of libraries that enable easy acceleration of quantum application development.  One of the libraries, [CUDA-Q QEC](https://nvidia.github.io/cudaqx/components/qec/introduction.html), is focused on error correction and can help expedite much of the work done above.  This final section will demonstrate how to run a code capacity memory experiment with the Steane code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A memory experiment is a procedure to test how well a protocol can preserve quantum information. Such an experiment can help assess the quality of a QEC code but is often limited by assumptions that deviate from a realistic noise model. One such example is a code capacity experiment. A code capacity procedure determines the logical error rate of a QEC code under strict assumptions such as perfect gates or measurement.  Code capacity experiments can help put an upper bound on a procedure's threshold and is therefore a good starting place to compare new codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is outlined in the diagram below.  Assume the 0000000 bitstring is the baseline (no error).  Bitflips are then randomly introduced and produce errors in the data vector to produce results like 0100010.  If this were a real test on a physical quantum device, the data vector would not be known and a user could only proceed through the bottom path in the figure - performing syndrome extraction and then decoding the result to see if a logical flip occurred. In a code capacity experiment, the data vector with errors is known, so it can be used to directly compute if a logical state flip occurred or not.  Dividing the number of times the actual (top path) and predicted (bottom path) results agree by the total number of rounds provides an estimate of the logical error rate for the code being tested. \n",

    "## 2.4 The Shor Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The first QEC code was proposed by Peter Shor in 1995, known as the [Shor code]((https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493)).  The Shor code is a [[9,1,3]] code which uses 9 qubits to encode a single qubit, but can correct single $X$ or $Z$-type errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for the code, is that the 3-qubit repetition code can correct bit flip errors but not phase flip errors.  We can consider why this is by examining the encoded $\\ket{+}_L$ state, which looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{+}_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}_{L~3\\mathrm{bit}}+\\ket{1}_{L~\\mathrm{3bit}}) =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{000}+\\ket{111}) $$\n",

This means there is no way to tell if a phase flip error occurred or not. One could produce the repetition code in the  $ \\ket{+}_L$ and $ \\ket{-}_L$ basis to correct $Z$ errors, but then the same problem would persist for $X$ errors.\n",
    "\n",

Note, because the Shor code has an extra layer of Hadamard gates, a $Z$ error impacts the $Z$ observable which is not the usual case.\n",
