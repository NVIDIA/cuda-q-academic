    "\n",
    "This is a really powerful approach, because it eliminates the need to derive and document the basis of the codespace in advance. Instead, one can simply define an appropriate set of stabilizers to establish the codespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stabilizer codes are usually characterized as $[[n,k,d]]$ (double brackets for quantum codes) where $n$ is the number of physical qubits encoding $k$ logical qubits with distance $d$. It is always the case that these codes require $n-k$ stabilizers. The reason for this is that each stabilizer splits the original $2^n$ Hilbert space in two (the +1 and -1 eigenspace), with $2^1 = 2$ degrees of freedom remaining to define the logical qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trick then becomes finding good sets of stabilizers that correspond to QEC codes with favorable properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stabilizer Properties \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key properties for $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each $s_i$ needs to be a Pauli-group element. The n-qubit Pauli group $G_n$ is a special group constructed from the Pauli matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad Z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The group $G_n$ consists of $4*4^n$ elements and is built by forming a group that begins with all possible length $n$ Pauli words. For example $G_3$ has  terms like $IZZ$, $ZXZ$, $YYY$, etc. The full group is then formed by multiplying each term by 1, -1, $i$, and $-i$. So $G_1$ would be\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$G_1 \\equiv \\{\\pm I, \\pm iI,\\pm Z, \\pm iZ,\\pm X, \\pm iX,\\pm Y, \\pm iY\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each $s_i$ must be able to operate on every logical state $\\ket{\\psi}_L$. Furthermore, this action should leave each $\\ket{\\psi}_L$ fixed (i.e., the eigenvalue of $\\ket{\\psi_L}$ should be +1 for each logical state).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stabilizers need to be measurable in any order. This means each stabilizer needs to **commute** with every other stabilizer (that is, $s_is_j = s_js_i$, or equivalently $[s_i, s_j] \\equiv s_is_j - s_js_i=0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any [[n,k,d]] code will require $n-k$ stabilizer measurements, so it is important to select the minimal set of $S$ (fewest operators necessary to define the set) such that it is no greater than $n-k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to stabilizers, each $[[n,k,d]]$ code needs $2k$ **logical operators** ($\\bar{X}_i$ and $\\bar{Z}_i$) which perform $X$ and $Z$ operations on the logical codewords. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{Z}_2\\bar{X}_1\\ket{11}_L = \\bar{Z}_2\\ket{01}_L = -\\ket{01}_L $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These logical operators must satisfy two properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\bar{X}_i$ and $\\bar{Z}_i$ commute with all stabilizers.\n",
    "2. Each logical operator must **anticommute** with one another (i.e.,  $\\{\\bar{X}_i,\\bar{Z}_j\\}\\equiv \\bar{X}_i\\bar{Z}_j + \\bar{Z}_j\\bar{X}_i= 0$ for all $i,j$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections will make use of stabilizers to solidify these concepts and enable coding of QEC codes far more interesting than the quantum repetition code. "

    "## The Shor Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The first QEC code was proposed by Peter Shor in 1995, known as the Shor code.  The Shor code is a [[9,1,3]] code which uses 9 qubits to encode a single qubit, but can correct single $X$ or $Z$-type errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for the code, is that the 3-qubit repetition code can correct bit flip errors but not phase flip errors.  Consider why this is. The encoded $\\ket{+}_L$ state looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{+}_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}_{L~3\\mathrm{bit}}+\\ket{1}_{L~\\mathrm{3bit}}) =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{000}+\\ket{111}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a $Z_1$, $Z_2$, or a $Z_3$ error occurs, the $ \\ket{+}_L$ state is transformed to $ \\ket{-}_L$, another valid codeword.  This means there is no way to tell if a phase flip error occurred or not. One could produce the repetition code in the  $ \\ket{+}$ and $ \\ket{-}_L$ basis to correct $Z$ errors, but then the same problem would persist for $X$ errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ingenuity behind the Shor code is to concatenate two 3-bit repetition codes into a 9-qubit code that can detect both types of errors. The encoding process begins with the 3-bit encoding of the $\\ket{+}$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{+}_{\\mathrm{3 bit}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{000}+\\ket{111})$$\n",

Similarly, for $\\bar{Z}$ to take $\\ket{1}_L$ to $-\\ket{1}_L$ (and $\\ket{0}_L$ to itself) all of the bits need to flip, thus  $\\bar{Z} = X_1X_2X_3X_4X_5X_6X_7X_8X_9$.

Extending this, all bit flip errors can be corrected with the following six stabilizers, two for each block.

    "\n",
    "[CUDA-QX](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-qx) is set of libraries that enable easy acceleration of quantum application development.  One of the libraries, [CUDA-Q QEC](https://nvidia.github.io/cudaqx/components/qec/introduction.html), is focused on error correction and can help expedite much of the work done above.  This final section will demonstrate how to run a code capacity analysis of the Steane code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Code capacity analysis can determine a code's logical error rate given a specific set of assumptions. The process is outlined in the diagram below.  Assume the 0000000 bitstring is the baseline (no error) logical state.  Then, randomly introduce bit flip errors which are represented by the data vector.  As the data after an error occurs is known in the experiment, not possible in practice, the top path can be used to determine if a logical state flipped (1) or not (0).  The bottom path instead extracts the syndromes and enters them into a decoder to make the same determination.  This bottom path is what your code above does.  If the two results do not match, a logical error occurred.\n",
