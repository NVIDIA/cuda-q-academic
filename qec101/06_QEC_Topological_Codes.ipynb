    "The previous lab discussed stabilizers, and how the stabilizer formalism can be a helpful tool for generating more complex QEC codes, particularly at scales where specifying the codewords is impractical.  The **toric code** is one of the most famous **topological** codes which combines the stabilizer formalism and principles of topology to produce a QEC code with a number of favorable properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Topology** is a branch of mathematics that studies objects abstractly and relates them to so called equivalence classes based on how they can or cannot be transformed into one another. The prototypical example given to introduce topology proposes that a doughnut and a coffee mug are in the same class (see image below), as they each have one hole while a shape like a sphere, would be in a different equivalence class.\n",

    "The coffee mug example, though certainly not rigorous and perhaps somewhat arbitrary, is an accessible glance into the sorts of distinctions topology can make to classify all sorts of geometries, even those that cannot be visualized.  Though the details of topology are well outside the scope of this lab, they provide the theoretical foundation of the surface code which takes advantage of the notion of equivalence classes to perform error correction on qubits arranged on a surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of the surface code is to define stabilizers as small repeating units that can be visually represented on a grid. Repeating such units results in a systematic way to increase the number of data qubits that encode one or more logical qubits, and increase the distance of the code. Defining the code on a grid pays dividends for leveraging topological principles to define errors and logical operations in such a way that lends itself to a nice visual interpretation.  Ideally, surface code errors are localized and can be visually inspected much like one can look at an image, assuming the pixels are large enough, and quickly identify which pixels are the wrong color.\n",

    "Certain types of QPUs (such as superconducting) are well suited for the surface code as qubits are already arranged on surface with nearest neighbor connectivity.\n",

    "The surface code also has a high **threshold**.  The threshold of a QEC code is the error rate required of physical qubits such that adding more physical qubits improves the logical error rate and does not make it worse.  A high threshold means that the surface code can tolerate physical qubits of lower relative quality than other codes. \n"

That is, two green squares share an edge. In the example below, the $X_2$ operations cancel out and the commutation relationship holds for the other operators acting on different qubits.\n",

When a $Z$ and an $X$ type operator act on the same qubit an anti-commutation relationship holds and a negative phase is added.  However, if this occurs for a pair of operators acting on a second qubit, the anti-commutation relationships cancel and the entire stabilizer commutes.\n",

In the section above, it was noted that the product of two overlapping plaquette (or vertex) stabilizers commute because the operation performed on the overlapping qubit cancels out.

There is no way to apply stabilizers to either state to recover $\\ket{\\psi}$ Therefore, such loops are in a different equivalence class.

For the toric code, this is impractical and instead, you can take advantage of the fact that if the stabilizers run on a register of all zeros, and then the ancilla qubits are measured, this will project the state into the codespace corresponding to the logical 0 state. \n",

    "## 6.5 Decoding the Toric Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to construct the toric code, it is important to think about errors and syndrome decoding so that the code can be put to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every data qubit (edge) is adjacent to exactly two faces and two vertices, hence, any single error (denoted by red text on a data quit) will produce a syndrome where two stabilizers flag (denoted as yellow squares for plaquette and orange circles for vetex stabilizers.) In the figure below, notice how easy it is to spot the localized errors, a key benefit of topological codes.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"Images/toric/singleerrors.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What gets complicated is the presence of multiple errors. Considering only $X$-type errors, Notice what happens if two adjacent errors occur. Now, the vertex stabilizer bordering both errors no longer fires, while the vertex diagonal to the first stabilizer now fires.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"Images/toric/diagonalstabilizers.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern can continue, placing the highlighted stabilizers in any position.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"Images/toric/distantstabilizers.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to say this is that a pair of stabilizers is connected by a string of edges with errors. So, it is very natural to understand which stabilizers fire given the error pattern. However, in practice,  you start with the syndrome results and must infer whihch errors occured occured with a decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to go about this, but we will focus on a traditional technique called **minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first principles of MWPM has to do with the minimum weight.  Consider a simple case where two stabilizers fire on opposite diagonals of a square in the grid. It is perfectly valid for any of the below error patterns to cause this syndrome. In fact, there are many other potential error patterns not shown. \n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"Images/toric/errorpatterns.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming errors are independent of one another, then the most likely error pattern is the one with the fewest number of errors, meaning pattern 1 or 2. If X's (blue) are applied as fixes to correct the errors, there are two minimum weight solutions depending on selection of pattern 1 or 2 as the error pattern. It turns out that in this case, it does not matter which one is chosen. If pattern 1 is the true error distribution and $X$ operations are applied to the two erroneous qubits, the errors are fixed.  If instead $X$'s are applied to the other half of the square, the errors are not fixed, but the fixes combined with the errors form a stabilizer and result in an overall operation that will obtain the original state either way!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/toric/twofixes.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If pattern 3, though much less likely, were the true error distribution, then applying the same MWPM corrections would still produce a stabilizer loop and ameliorate all the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/toric/largecorrectionstabilizer.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This would not be the case for pattern 4.  If the same corrections are applied, a stabilizer loop is not formed, nor are the errors corrected. Instead, a loop corresponding to a logical operation is closed.  This means, the fixes would perform an unexpected logical bitflip and result in a logical error, the worst case scenario. This is why the toric code has a distance of 5, as you need at least 5 errors to complete a vertical or horizontal loop and produce a logical error.  Increasing the grid size makes logical errors less likley, but comes at the cost of $L^2$ scaling data qubit overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/toric/logicalerror.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The perfect matching part of MWPM concerns that fact that a valid syndrome can be composed of any even number of stabilizers firing. So, finding the MWPM solution requires solving a larger minimization problem to consider all pairs of stabilizers, and the minimium number of errors required to connect each stabilizer in each pair.   This means considering all possible parings of the stabilizers and the shortest paths for each pairing, a much more complex optimization problem.\n",

    "## 6.7 The Planar and Surface Codes ##\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems with the toric code is that it is not very practical. Some qubit modalities could utilize the toric code, but many modalities such as superconducting cannot as there is no easy way to map a torus to qubits arranged on a plane.  This requires some modifications to produce the famous surface code that is much more practical and the basis for many experimental QEC demonstrations today. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the steps to get there. First, the toric code is transformed into the planar code by eliminating the periodic boundary conditions and capping one pair of parallel slides to form a smooth edge. The other edge is called a rough edge. This allows the code to now lie in a plane which is much more suitable for hardware implementation.  \n",

    "<img src=\"Images/toric/rotated.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"1000\">\n",

    "Changing the topology does impact the logical encoding.  Now it is not possible to form loops around the smooth edges (top to bottom) resulting in the loss of a degree of freedom and therefore a logical qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to improve on the planar code with a few transformations that allow encoding of a logical qubit with the same distance but using fewer data qubits. If you place a green or purple square on each vertex and plaquette stabilizer, respectively,  and then rotate by 45 degrees, the basis for the so called rotated surface code is formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Special boundary 2-qubit stabilizers are added around the faces of the surface to finish the code layout. Previously all error chains flagged exactly two stabilizers. Now, if an error chain starts on the boundary, it is possible to only flag a single stabilizer.  Thus, this must be taken into account when decoding.\n",

    "Topological codes are central to both the history of QEC and much of the current research literature.  after completing this lab, you should have a better understanding of what a topological code is, why it is used, and a basic understanding of their inner workings.  In addition, coding the toric code in CUDA-Q provides deeper insight into the challenges of implementing such a code.   "
