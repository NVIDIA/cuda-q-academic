    "# ADAPT-VQE algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a well known quantum chemistry technique, which estimates the ground state of a molecule by optimizing a parameterized ansatz through iterative loops involving expectation values computed on a QPU and classical parameter updates performed by a supercomputer.  VQE suffers from a a number of issues including costly sampling of the Hamiltonian terms, and the so called barren plateau problem where even modest problems sizes do not converge due to the flat optimization landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "For VQE to have any viability for near term applications, clever implementations are necessary to avoid these challenges. One promising approch is the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter VQE (ADAPT-VQE) approach. The core idea is rather than have a fixed ansatz, to \"adaptively\" build the ansatz over the course of the algorithm by performing the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. On classical hardware, compute the one and two-electron integrals and transform the Hamiltonian to a qubit representation.\n",
    "2. Build an operator pool, usually corresponding to physical excitations from techniques like unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD).\n",
    "3. Initialize qubits in a reference Hatree Fock state.\n",
    "4. Measure the commutator of the Hamiltonian with each operator in the operator pool to compute the gradient.\n",
    "5. If the norm of the gradient is below a threshold, then exit.  Otherwise, add the operator with the largest gradient contribution along with a new variational parameter, $\\theta_{i+1}$.\n",
    "6. Run VQE on this circuit to obtain optimized variational parameters.\n",
    "7. Repeat steps 4 through 6 until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the steps are represented below in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/adapt_vqe/adapt_workflow.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"1300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a careful reader, this may seem like a we are now running an entire VQE experiment for each iteration.  This is correct, but, the additive constructions of the ansatz means that we begin with very simple and easy to optimize circuits relative to a starting a VQE procedure with a fixed ansatz with many circuit parameters. Using the gradient allows strategic operator selection so we are optimizing parameters for operators more likely to converge to the ground state. Adding new parameters one at a time to an already converged solution allows each iteration to begin with a warm start.  In practice, ADAPT-VQE generally converges faster than VQE and is more resilient to barren plateaus given this warm start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better sense of the process for ADAPT-VQE and how it compares with VQE, try the following interactive widget linked [here](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-q-academic/chemistry-simulations/Images/adapt_vqe/adapt_widget.html).

    "## Building the Operator Pool and Computing the Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building the entire workflow, it is helpful to construct some of the subroutines. You will begin by creating subroutines to define the operator pool and to compute the gradient.  First, consider the operator pool. Any Pauli word could be placed in the operator pool. An operator $A_i$ can then be selected and applied to a quantum circuit as $e^{-i\\theta_iA_i}$ to build a parameterized quantum circuit ansatz. For traditional VQE, the same procedure is used, except all of the operators are applied *a priori* to construct a fixed parametrized ansatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naively one might think that a bigger and more diverse operator pool is inherently better. However, because quantum chemistry has certain symmetries, many operators would be poor choices and even violate physical constraints of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common choice of operators ubiquitous in chemistry  comes from unitary coupled cluster with single and double excitations (UCCSD). Where single excitations are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_{ij} = \\frac{i}{2}(X_iY_j - Y_iX_j)\\prod_{p=i+1}^{j-1} Z_p $$\n",

    "## Parallelizing ADAPT-VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, data centers will host multiple QPUs, allowing quantum algorithms to parallelize and run faster. For example, obtaining one million circuit samples can be accomplished by pooling 100,000 samples from 10 QPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "ADAPT-VQE is well suited to benefit from parallelization in a few parts of the code. In the next exercise, you will explore how this can speed up the runtime of ADAPT-VQE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the commutators for the gradient in each ADAPT-VQE step is a trivially parallelizable task.  Each operator is independent of the others, so each one can be evaluated on a separate QPU.  CUDA-Q's MQPU backend allows you to simulate this by designating each circuit to run on a different virtual QPU simulated by a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the code below to see how this is done.  Simply change the backend with `cudaq.set_target('nvidia', option='mqpu,fp64')` and `cudaq.observe` with `cudaq.observe_async` and add a variable `qpu_id` which specifies an integer corresponding to your index of available GPUs. These results are run asynchronously and stored in a list of futures which are then accessed later with `get()`.  One slight complication is when the initial set and subsequent states are obtained with `get_state`, they must also be updated to `get_state_async`.  You can no longer save the new state at the end of each new iteration as the `get_state_async` needs to run on the same `qpu_id` as the command computing the expectation value, otherwise the state will be prepared on a different GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 5:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to further parallelize the code and modify the `parameter_shift` function, which computes the gradient of the VQE step, to run asynchronously across two simulated QPUs.  Use the parallel code for the commutator evaluation as a guide for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, add flags to capture the execution of the serial and parallel implementations.  Then, run them on LiH for a maximum of 5 steps (iterations).  Do you notice a difference?  You may not, and this is because the problem is too small to benefit from the overhead required to distribute the information across multiple simulated QPUs.  Increase the maximum number of steps to 15 and try again.  Now do you notice the difference?  The longer ADAPT-VQE runs, the harder each circuit evaluation and VQE procedure becomes, meaning there is greater benefit from using parallelization.  Similar to the fact that a GPU must be used for a problem large enough to benefit from parallelization, asynchronous execution across multiple QPUs will be most valuable when the individual tasks are harder. \n"

    "At this point, you have coded an ADAPT-VQE implementation of your own and explored specific parts of the workflow in detail like operator pool selection. There is great benefit in understanding the details, but often it is helpful to have an out-of-the-box implementation that is optimized and easy to plug into your larger workflow or ready to generate data for your research.  CUDA-Q Solvers provides easy to use ADAPT-VQE functions so you can produce the same results without the need to code at the kernel level. \n",

    "ADAPT methods can also be generalized beyond chemistry and extend to problems like QAOA.  [This tutorial](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/adapt_qaoa.html) in the CUDA-Q docs demonstrates how one can setup a QAOA problem and iteratively add layers where the mixer Hamiltonian is selected via the ADAPT process, leading to faster convergence. If you have completed the series [Divide-and-Conquer QAOA for MaxCut](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/qaoa-for-max-cut), a good exercise might be to revisit your code and try improving it with it with ADAPT-QAOA. \n",

    "Though ADAPT methods have clear benefits over conventional variational algorithms, they still suffer from the same fundamental measurements problems and barren plateaus for large problem sizes. Nevertheless, they are fantastic drop-in substitutions for any situation where a variation method is used for a subroutine like state preparation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing beyond ADAPT methods, with this notebook you have learned how to use fundamental CUDA-Q functions like `exp_pauli`, `get_state_async` and `observe_async` as well as how to use a CUDA-Q Solvers method out-of-the box.  To learn more, visit the [CUDA-Q docs page](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/index.html) and the [CUDA-Q Solvers docs](https://nvidia.github.io/cudaqx/examples_rst/solvers/examples.html).\n"
