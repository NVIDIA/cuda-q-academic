    "# Krylov Quantum Subspace Diagonalization\n",
    "\n",
    "The Krylov quantum subspace diagonalization method is a powerful hybrid quantum chemistry method for estimating ground state energies, taking advantage of quantum computers to build a matrix and using a classical supercomputer to diagonalize that matrix.   The method has advantages over variational approaches and is a promising technique for early fault tolerant quantum computing. This lab will introduce the Krylov method, guide you through implementing it in CUDA-Q, teach you how to improve results, and parallelize computations across multiple QPUs.\n",

    "### Quantum Subspace Diagonalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing methods for quantum chemistry lie on a spectrum from NISQ methods to methods suited for large-scale fault tolerant quantum computers. The problem that we'll be considering in this notebook is to find the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian.  Mathematically, this is equivalent to finding the lowest eigenvalue of a given matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototypical NISQ algorithm is the [Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/vqe_advanced.html) which computes ground state energies by classically optimizing a parameterized circuit and computing expectation values for the cost function. These circuits are shallow which is a favorable trait, but the number of measurements needed each round scales O($n^4$) with the size of the Hamiltonian.  Most problematic is the fact that circuits corresponding to even modest qubit counts have extremely flat optimization surfaces and tend to not converge which is the so called \"barren plateau\" problem. Even when convergence is possible, the number of iterations required may become intractably large.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side of the spectrum, quantum phase estimation (QPE) is hallmark fault tolerant algorithm for quantum chemistry.  Given a good initial state, QPE can compute ground state energies with exponential precision, but requires extremely deep circuits due to the necessity of the [quantum Fourier transform](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/quantum_fourier_transform.html) in most implementations. QPE is extremely sensitive to errors, requiring very low error rates to function. Consequently, it relies on quantum error correction protocols ([Learn more in our QEC 101 course)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/qec101), which are resource-intensive and demand thousands to millions of physical qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Krylov methods are a bridge between the two and balance tradeoffs to potentially result in useful applications on devices that are more near term. The main idea is to reduce the size of the matrix to a smaller one and compute the eigenvalues of this smaller matrix.  If chosen well, the lowest eigenvalues of the smaller matrix and the larger one agree. The Krylov approach is a subset of broader quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) methods which try to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in a general non-orthogonal basis. In other words, given an initial state that is close to the ground state, the Krylov method will help identify a good subspace of the Hamiltonian to diagonalize such that the best possible estimates of the extreme eigenvalues (i.e., the ground state) are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an approach requires circuits of moderate depth and uses them to populate matrix elements of a Hamiltonian subspace which is then classically diagonalized.   Krylov methods still suffer from the O($n^4$) Hamiltonian scaling as the full Hamiltonian must be measured to compute subspace matrix elements.  However, increasing the subspace dimension exponentially leads to convergence towards the ground state energy, which could outperform the many VQE iterations required for larger problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widget below will provide some intuition for subspace diagonalization and why Krylov methods work.  Given the 8x8 matrix below, move the slider to select a subspace dimension and look at the computed eigenvalues.  Notice the ground state energy converges to the exact ground state while the other eigenvalues remain rather inaccurate.  Subspace methods are quite good at estimating the extreme eigenvalues (highest or lowest) which is favorable as the lowest eigenvalue (the ground state energy) is usually the quantity of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click [this link](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-q-academic/chemistry-simulations/Images/krylov.html) to access the widget\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense for why a good initial state is important (more on that later), choose which corner the subspace originates from in the widget. Notice, the approximate eigenvalues are much worse when the subspace is constructed from certain corners which happen to capture less information about the eigen spectrum of the matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the quantum Krylov methods, a good approximation of the ground state will help construct a better subspace for estimating the ground state energy.\n"

The subspace can then be gradually increased in size and the process repeated until the result is sufficiently accurate.\n",

    "In the previous section you calculated that for even a modest sized molecule like $LiH$, over 26,000 circuits need to run to compute all of the expectation values.  This does not factor in sampling on a physical QPU which would significantly increase this. The good news is that the Krylov approach is highly parallelizable, and, in theory, all of these circuits could be run asynchronously on a sufficient number of physical QPUs. Accelerated quantum supercomputers will eventually include multiple QPUs in a single data center and allow such computations to occur alongside supercomputers.\n",

    "First, consider the function $\\texttt{populate\\_h}$. Each matrix element requires computation of an expectation value for every Pauli word in the Hamiltonian.  We will focus on parallelizing computation of the real and imaginary parts of each of these.

    "The Krylov QSD approach is a powerful and versatile tool. This lab has introduced the underlying theory that allowed you to implement your own version and explore several ways to improve results and accelerate the algorithm with parallelization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid nature of the Krylov approach is excellent for balancing the need for quantum computers to evaluate expectation values from large Hibert spaces, but do so in a way that a subspace matrix can be constructed and solved classically.  A very promising aspect of Krylov methods is the fact that they can be combined with other quantum computing approaches. For example, it is perfectly valid to prepare the reference state and then run Krylov QSD to refine the prediction.  This further creates a robust hybrid workflow that builds upon other quantum techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a challenge, if you have completed the [ADAPT-VQE](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/chemistry-simulations) CUDA-Q Academic lab, see if you can combine these two methods into a single workflow."
