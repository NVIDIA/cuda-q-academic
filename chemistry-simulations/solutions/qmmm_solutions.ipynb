    "## An overview of QM/MM\n",
    "\n",
    "**[QM/MM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QM/MM)** is a **multi-scale** technique most useful in situations where the key properties of a chemical reaction are dominated by the interactions of a small number of atoms within an environment of many atoms. Ideally, one would simulate the entire environment with high accuracy methods.  However, this requires simulation of highly complex quantum systems which quickly become too complex for even the best supercomputers. \n",
    "\n",
    "One could choose to ignore the environment, but it does impact the results and can lead to qualitatively wrong predictions.  A reasonable approximation is to split the problem into a high accuracy **QM** (quantum mechanics) region within a low accuracy **MM** (molecular mechanics/classical) region. This compromise can often result in more reliable predictions with a fraction of the compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QM part is often simulated with something like DFT, Hartree-Fock, Coupled Cluster, etc, while the MM part is described by classical molecular mechanics using force fields. However, this depends on the specific scales in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common situations for QM/MM are a drug binding to a large protein or a chemical reaction occurring in solution.  The image below shows an example from [\"A Projector-Embedding Approach for Multiscale Coupled-Cluster Calculations Applied to Citrate Synthase\"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00285)  where the authors studied the first step of the citric acid cycle using high-accuracy QM simulations within the environment of an enzyme modeled with lower quality methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Images/qmmm/qmmm_example.png\"  title=\"Landscape Image\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The trickiest part of QM/MM is determining how the two regions interact. All schemes introduce some sort of error.  For example, one approach is called subtractive QM/MM where the entire system is computed with MM methods, then the small region alone is computed with MM methods and subtracted, finally the small region is computed with QM and added back in.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{subtractive} = E_{All}^{MM} - E_{Small}^{MM} + E_{Small}^{QM} \\ne E_{All}^{QM}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that both the MM and QM computations on the small region ignore interactions with the large region so error is introduced. There are a number of similar ways, but all hinge on the nature of the interaction between the regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more sophisticated approach is to set up the problem such that the QM and MM regions interact through a polarizable embedding scheme. The steps for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the geometry of all molecules and specify the molecules in the QM and MM regions.\n",
    "2. Using an electronic structure method, compute the ground state of the QM region using an adjusted Hamiltonian that depends on the density of the MM region.\n",
    "3. Use the resulting wavefunction to compute the one particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM).\n",
    "4. Compute the induced dipoles in the MM region based on the 1-RDM.\n",
    "5. Recompute the energy of the QM region using the new MM dipoles.\n",
    "6. Repeat until self-consistent field (SCF) convergence of the energy and density.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure allows the two regions to interact and provides a more realistic approximation of the physics within the QM region. To get a sense of how this works with a visualization, try the widget linked [here](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-q-academic/chemistry-simulations/Images/qmmm_widget.html). "

    "## Some Technical Prerequisites (Adjusted Hamiltonians and RDMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Construction of the QM/MM workflow requires a few technical prerequisites worth reviewing. The starting point is the standard molecular Hamiltonian for the a molecule in a vacuum ($H_0 = T_e + T_N + V_{ee} + V_{eN} + V_{NN}$), which contains the typical electron and nuclear interaction terms. However, to compute the total energy of the QM region, an additional term $H_{pe}$ is needed to capture the interaction between the electrons in the QM region and the induced dipoles of the MM region.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{QM} = H_0 + H_{pe}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ H_{pe}$ is the bridge which allows the SCF procedure to optimize the QM ground state and the MM region dipoles simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the technical details related to computing the induced dipoles and the $H_{pe}$ coefficients are beyond the scope for this lab and will be handled by external tools like the [CPPE library](https://github.com/maxscheurer/cppe). Curious readers can see the full derivation in [\"The variational quantum eigensolver self-consistent field method within a polarizable embedded framework\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01926).\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular item that does warrant additional discussion is the **one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM)**.  This matrix contains information about *all* single electron properties of the QM wavefunction and is the key quantity needed from the QM wavefunction to update $H_{pe}$.  Given a wavefunction $\\ket{\\Psi}$ composed of spin orbitals $\\psi_i$, the 1-RDM is the matrix $\\gamma_{pq} = \\bra{\\Psi} a_p^{\\dagger}a_p \\ket{\\Psi}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix elements can be computed using a quantum computer and evaluating the following observables with a prepared state.\n",

    "The loop will continue until the final VQE energy no longer changes between iterations, i.e. the orbitals (within the filed of the induced dipoles) is converged.  One slight caveat is that the final VQE energy is not the final energy of the procedure.  First, the interaction term $\\bra{\\theta_*}H_{pe/old}\\ket{\\theta_*}$ needs to be subtracted from the VQE energy, leaving only $\\bra{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}H_{0}\\ket{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}$.  Then, the $E_{pe} = E_{MM} + \\bra{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}H_{pe/new}\\ket{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}$ term is added directly from the CPPE library output. This ensures the final result properly sums the energy of the QM region, the MM region, and the interaction between the two without double counting.\n",

    "Now, you are ready to run the full QM/MM loop started for you below. You will be filling in the sections labeled TODO.  The first step is to run VQE using the modified (PE included) Hamiltonian. The code below then saves that state which is used as an input for your `compute_1_rdm` function that returns the appropriate 1-RDM computed in the molecular orbitals basis. The following steps are needed:\n",

(Done for you) The function called $\\texttt{pe\\_operator}$ takes the 1-RDM in the AO basis and, using CPPE, computes a new set of induced dipoles and updates the Hamiltonian term $V_{PE}$, resulting in a new `spin_pe_ham` variable. It also computes a new energy of the classical MM region $E_{PE}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "4.  (TODO - 3) Compute the final energy after the main QM/MM loop is finished.  That is, $ \\bra{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}H_0 + H_{pe/old}\\ket{\\Psi(\\theta_*)} -  \\bra{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}H_{pe/old}\\ket{\\Psi(\\theta_*)}E_{PE/new} + E_{pe}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the key benefits of QM/MM methods is flexibility. The QM region can be expanded as needed to more faithfully capture the chemistry of the system and, in principle, the QM and the MM parts of the code can swap with many different methods to optimize tradeoffs for accuracy and speed as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will explore two such approaches for modifying your current workflow to tackle larger problems.  The first demonstration will simulate the NH$_3$ molecule within solution (modeled by 46 adjacent water molecules in the MM region.).   The classical cost to include the extra water molecules is minimal but can provide a better model for a solution phase molecule compared to the LiH example above with only two water molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The costly change here is moving from LiH to NH$_3$ which would require 30 qubits to simulate with a 6-31G basis set.  One solution is to use an active space where only a subset of the highest energy occupied orbitals and lowest energy virtual orbitals are included.  This approximation greatly reduces the number of qubits while, hopefully, still capturing enough of the physics to produce a \"good enough\" result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, active space selection is a non-trivial task and should be undertaken with great care, especially if high accuracy is required. It can usually provide a significant reduction in cost with minimal loss in accuracy if done properly. \n",
