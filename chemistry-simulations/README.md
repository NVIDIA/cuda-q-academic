## Notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks in this folder are designed to run on GPUs in an environment with CUDA-Q and Python.  For instructions on how to install CUDA-Q on your machine, check out this [guide](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/quick_start.html#install-cuda-q).  A Dockerfile and requirements.txt are also included in the main directory of the repository to help get you set up.

Otherwise, if you have set up an account in Google CoLab, 
simply log in to the account, then click on the icons below to run the notebooks on the listed platform.
