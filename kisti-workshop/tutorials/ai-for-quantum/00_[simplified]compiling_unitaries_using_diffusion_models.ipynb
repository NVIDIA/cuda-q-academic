    "\n",
    "Quantum computing relies on efficiently translating quantum operations into viable physical realizations on existing quantum hardware. This compilation task can be a computationally intensive task. Recently machine learning techniques have demonstrated exceptional performance on this task (see, for instance [(Moro et al., 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-021-00684-3) and [(Fürrutter, et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00831-9)).\n",

    "This notebook focuses on circuit synthesis with diffusion models [(Fürrutter, et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00831-9) — a powerful class of generative models in machine learning. We will demonstrate how to use this method to synthesize arbitrary unitaries into a `cudaq.kernel`, effectively decomposing them into sequences of quantum gates, a process commonly known as unitary compilation.\n",
    "In particular, we will use a pre-trained model to generate circuits with specific characteristics, such as being limited to a restricted set of gates, for a given unitary.  The following figure provides an overview of the circuit generation pipeline:\n"

    "The pipeline consists of 3 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Circuit encoding:** Like any neural network, diffusion models operate with continuous inputs and outputs. However, since the circuits we consider are composed of discrete gates (i.e., with no continuous parameters), we develop a mapping that transforms each gate into a continuous vector. This allows us to represent a given circuit as a three-dimensional tensor, as illustrated. Crucially, this mapping is invertible: when the DM generates continuous tensors, we can apply the inverse map to convert them back into the circuit form. "

   },
   "source": [
    "**2) Conditioning:** The user's input (the set of available gates and the unitary to compile) is also transformed into a continuous tensor by two neural networks. For the gate set description, where the input is a text prompt (e.g., \"Compile using ['x', 'h']\"), we utilize a pre-trained language model. For the unitary, we employ a neural network that is trained jointly with the diffusion model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Unitary compilation:** The generation procedure follows the typical DM process: the model is given a fully noisy tensor which is iteratively de-noised until reaching a clean sample based on the given conditioning (the desired unitary and gate set). The tensors generated by the DM are then mapped to circuits via the inverse encoding procedure. To learn more about the practical implementation of diffusion models, we recommend [this tutorial](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson9.html).\n",

    "Let's start by defining the unitary that we want to compile. Note that this model has been trained to compile unitaries arising from circuits composed of the gates `['h', 'cx', 'z', 'x', 'ccx', 'swap']`. Although this is a universal gate set (i.e., a gate set capable of universal computation), performing arbitrary computations requires an unlimited number of gates. For this tutorial, we will use a model trained to generate kernels with at most 12 gates. Therefore, we can only expect the model to work for unitaries under this constraint. Let's consider here the compilation of one of such unitary. \n",
