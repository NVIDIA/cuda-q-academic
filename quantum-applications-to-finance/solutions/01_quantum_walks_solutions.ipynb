CUDA-Q offers several pre-defined gates, which you can explore in detail [here](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/api/default_ops.html). As demonstrated in the following example, you can also define custom gate operations from a unitary matrix using the `register_operation` command.  Additionally, it is possible to create operators controlled by a control qubit.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's consider a discrete walk taking place on a line. In this scenario, we envision a walker progressing along the \n",
    "x-axis in discrete increments, with the movement governed by predefined rules based on coin flips.  A classical random walk can be viewed as a decision tree, as in the diagram below.  Here, a walker begins in the center of the line. After a coin flip, the walker moves to the left or right depending on the outcome of the coin flip (e.g., flipping heads will send the walker one step to the left, while flipping tails will send the walker one step to the right).  After $n$ coin flips, we record the position of the walker.  This experiment is repeated multiple times to generate a histogram of the walker's final position.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/classical-walk.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW)** is the quantum analogue of a classical random walk. In this scenario, both the position of the walk and the coin are represented as quantum states, $\\ket{\\psi_W}$ and $\\ket{\\psi_C}$, respectively. Throughout this walk, the state of the walker changes according to quantum shift operators ($S_+, S_-$) which depend on the state of the coin $\\ket{\\psi_C}$. In particular, the $S_{-}$ operation checks if $\\ket{\\psi_C}$ in the state $\\ket{0}$ (i.e., heads) and if so, induces a shift left operation $DEC$ on the quantum walker. Similarly, $S_{+}$ is defined for tails and shifting right. At each time step, the state of the coin changes (i.e., is \"flipped\") via a quantum operation ($F$), which we'll call the coin-flip operator. Unlike the classical random walk, we will not know the position of the walker until the end of the process, when the quantum state of the walker is measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram below, we illustrate a 2-step quantum walk where the coin-flip operator $F$ is the Hadamard gate.  Notice how the final distribution of the walker's possible positions differs from the classical case.\n",

    "#### The Line that the Walker Traverses\n",
    " For our example, we consider a line that contains $16$ positions: $0,1,\\cdots,15$ encoded with the computational basis states on $4$ qubits: $\\ket{\\bf{0}} = \\ket{0000}, \\ket{\\bf{1}} = \\ket{0001}, \\ket{\\bf{2}} = \\ket{0010}, \\cdots, \\ket{\\bf{15}} = \\ket{1111}$.  In other words, the computational basis state $\\ket{\\bf{i}}$ represents the $i^{th}$ location on the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Walker's Position State\n",
    "The walker's position after $t$ time steps is given by a linear combination of the computational basis states $$\\ket{\\psi_W} = \\sum_{i}\\alpha_i(t)\\ket{\\bf{i}},$$ for some $\\alpha_i(t)\\in\\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $\\sum_{i}|\\alpha_i(t)|^2 = 1$.  For instance, if the walker began the experiment at position $0$, then the state of the walker at time $0$ would be $\\ket{\\psi_W(0)}=\\ket{0000}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More interestingly, the walker might begin the experiment in a superposition of two or more positions, as depicted in the figure below.  In this case, the walker's initial state is $\\ket{\\psi_W(0)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0010}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0011}$.

    "#### Walking the Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step (no pun intended) is to define incrementer (`INC`) and decrementer (`DEC`) operations, which will change the state of the walker with shifts to the left and right on the number line, respectively.  We'll use these operations to build up the shift operators $S_-$ and $S_+$ which depend on the state of the coin.  First, let's define `INC` so that when applied to a basis state $\\ket{x}$, the result is $\\ket{(x+1)_{\\mod{16}}}$ for $x\\in \\{0,\\cdots 15\\}$.  The unitary matrix below carries out this transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots  \\\\ \n",
    "                        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\\n",
    "                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\\n",
    "                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\\n",
    "                        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `cudaq.register_operation` we can create a custom gate for this unitary matrix. The code block defines a `cudaq.kernel` to carry out the custom INC gate, and conducts a test to verify that the operation acts as expected on the zero state.  \n"

These will allow us to generate more interesting probability distributions than what we can do with the DTQW, which may better model financial data.  "
