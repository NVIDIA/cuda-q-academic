Welcome to the hybrid workflows learning path.  

In this path you will learn about workflows that leverage classical AI supercomputing alongside QPUs. Note that most of the other CUDA-Q academic learning pathways focus on hybrid workflows too.  This path will capture lessons that are more general or do not fit within the other more targeted pathways like "chemistry simulations".

## Notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks in this folder are designed to run on GPUs in an environment with CUDA-Q and Python.  For instructions on how to install CUDA-Q on your machine, check out this [guide](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/quick_start.html#install-cuda-q).  A Dockerfile and requirements.txt are also included in the main directory of the repository to help get you set up.

Otherwise, if you have set up an account in Google CoLab, 
simply log in to the account, then click on the icons below to run the notebooks on the listed platform.
